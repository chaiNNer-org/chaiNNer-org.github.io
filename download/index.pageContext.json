Alpha v0.24.1\nThis update contains a few bug fixes and some more QOL improvements.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Add UI for anchor/position dropdowns by @RunDevelopment in #2940\r\n* Add \"Install

Fixes\r\n* (PyTorch) Fix incorrect tile size estimations after upscaling optimizations by @joeyballentine in #2929\r\n* Fix output types for the Resolutions node by @RunDevelopment in #2937\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.24.0...v0.24.1\n# Alpha v0.24.0\nThis update brings many new major features to chaiNNer, including but not limited to conditional branching (via two new nodes: Conditional and Compare), node passthrough/skipping, new themes, PyTorch optimizations, and many more fixes and quality of life improvements all around.\r\n\r\nThe conditional and compare nodes bring a long-awaited feature: branching support. Well, mostly. These nodes allow you to switch between inputs based on a condition created by comparing two values in various ways. This means users can finally set up chains that do one thing under a certain condition and another thing under a different one (e.g. if an image is over a certain size vs under a certain size). The thing to keep in mind is how you have to set this up might be opposite of what's intuitive. Since you're switching between values, it's what comes _before_ the condition that is decided between, not what comes after.\r\n\r\nThe disable toggle has also been replaced with a button that allows you to swap between three states: \"enabled\", \"disabled\", and \"skipped\". In skipped mode, the node will not be run, but it also will not disable downstream nodes like disabling it would. This is another heavily-requested feature that we are happy is finally in chaiNNer.\r\n\r\nNew themes can be selected in settings. This is semi-experimental as we plan on adding support for fully custom themes in the future, as well as improving the existing default selection. The current selection is mainly just a proof of concept to show that we _can_ support themes of some kind, and also to give users some options for customization. We'd love to hear feedback on the current selection and if you have any suggestions on themes to add.\r\n\r\nPyTorch upscaling has been heavily optimized. I was able to using a visual profiling tool (called VizTracer, which I highly recommend for anyone wanting to optimize a python project) to see what was slowing down upscaling. Upscaling has been optimized to a point where it's roughly 1.25x faster than it was before (though YMMV depending on what model you use, as well as other factors). While not perfect, it's still a large improvement and should help your PyTorch upscaling chains run faster.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n* Support passthrough/skipping nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2805, #2864, #2887\r\n* Add new themes by @joeyballentine in #2833, #2847, #2874, #2921\r\n* Various optimizations to PyTorch upscaling by @joeyballentine in #2853, #2852, #2861, #2859, #2858, #2860, #2862, #2869, #2884, #2886\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n* Add avif support by @the-database in #2820\r\n* Add convolve usage example by @BigBoyBarney in #2827\r\n* (PyTorch) Add custom tiling option by @the-database in #2828, #2870, #2880\r\n* (PyTorch) Update spandrel (adds support for PLKSR, RealPLKSR, IPT, SAFMN_BCIE, DRCT) by @RunDevelopment in #2837, #2846\r\n* Default chain file saving to documents folder by @joeyballentine in #2836\r\n* Rename parameters of numeric inputs and clean up parameters by @RunDevelopment in #2863\r\n* Increase font size for type tags by @RunDevelopment in #2865\r\n* Make all Switch inputs optional by @RunDevelopment in #2867\r\n* Slightly redesign the Math node by @RunDevelopment, @joeyballentine in #2868, #2873\r\n* Better type errors for text nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2871\r\n* Add \"order\" dropdown for both spritesheet nodes by @joeyballentine in #2878\r\n* Improve style of multiline text area by @RunDevelopment in #2885\r\n* Add a \"simple\" mode for saving video by @joeyballentine in #2879\r\n* Slightly more space for text in dropdowns by @RunDevelopment in #2892\r\n* Slightly more compact Save Video node by @RunDevelopment in #2893\r\n* Optimize away Passthrough nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2896\r\n* Add type color for Booleans by @joeyballentine in #2891\r\n* Add type color for Colors by @joeyballentine in #2898, #2904\r\n* Stricter condition for type assignability by @RunDevelopment in #2902\r\n* Select best-matching node based on search query by @RunDevelopment in #2903\r\n* Support connected handles with multiple colors by @RunDevelopment in #2906\r\n* Better type error message for division by zero by @RunDevelopment in #2907\r\n* Fix assignability for outputs with errors by @RunDevelopment in #2909\r\n* Add special suggestion for Math and Compare nodes in node selector by @RunDevelopment in #2908\r\n* Mention node names in error messages by @RunDevelopment in #2920\r\n* Add similarity check to ONNX model conversions by @RunDevelopment in #2915\r\n* Add support for ONNX type and tag broadcasting by @RunDevelopment in #2919\r\n* Improve types for model conversion nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2925\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n* Add \"Compare\" & \"Conditional\" nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2866, #2895\r\n* Add \"Image Align with Rife\" and \"Wavelet Color Fix\" Nodes by @pifroggi, @RunDevelopment in #2714, #2888, #2889\r\n* Add \"Regex Find\" node by @RunDevelopment in #2855\r\n* Add \"Separate Color\" node by @joeyballentine, @RunDevelopmentg in #2897, #2910\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed input gathering for collectors by @RunDevelopment in #2818\r\n* Use `atexit` to always kill worker by @RunDevelopment in #2822\r\n* Rework GPU API to fix issues with older GPUs by @RunDevelopment in #2821\r\n* Avoid RGB contamination by transparent pixels in \"Color Transfer\" node by @Splendide-Imaginarius in #2389\r\n* Prevent chain files from being saved in install directory by @joeyballentine in #2835\r\n* Fix that empty string was not allowed as the default value by @RunDevelopment in #2856\r\n* Fix converting indexed PIL images to NumPy by @RunDevelopment in #2881\r\n* Fix node documentation modal opening on reload by @joeyballentine in #2883\r\n* Fix timing issue for lazy inputs by @RunDevelopment in #2890\r\n* Prevent log spam by not logging useless stack traces by @RunDevelopment in #2900\\\r\n* Fix image pairs length validation when using limit by @joeyballentine in #2917\r\n* (ONNX) Fix size requirement padding by @RunDevelopment in #2918\r\n* Add status API to get executor status to prevent stale/stuck status by @RunDevelopment in #2928\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @the-database made their first contribution in #2820\r\n* @pifroggi made their first contribution in #2714\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.23.2...v0.24.0\n# Alpha v0.23.3\nThis is a hotfix release to fix a regression introduced in the v0.23.2 which caused iterators to error when running.

You know the drill.\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n* (PyTorch) Update to spandrel v0.2.1 by @RunDevelopment in #2487\r\n  -   Adds support for SAFMN and fixes a few minor issues with upscaling small images.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Add \"Copy\" to right-click context menus by @joeyballentine in #2473\r\n* Make Save Video input names consistent with Save Image by @RunDevelopment in #2480\r\n* Correctly show mixed iterator-non-iterator inputs/outputs by @RunDevelopment in #2481\r\n* Avoid running non-chosen \"Switch\" node paths by @RunDevelopment in #2477\r\n* Pad images according to size requirements when upscaling by @RunDevelopment in #2485\r\n* Add PyTorch memory budget limit setting by @joeyballentine in #2472\r\n* Add \"Manual/Copy\" install mode to dependency manager by @joeyballentine in #2462\r\n* Mark iterated inputs/outputs as sequenced in docs by @RunDevelopment in #2495\r\n* Fix iterator limit and improved output types by @RunDevelopment in #2496\r\n* Fix iterator lineage checks in UI by @RunDevelopment in #2494, #2498\r\n* Allow handles for \"Merge Spritesheet\" number inputs by @RunDevelopment in #2499\r\n* Rename \"Strengthen Normals\" to \"Scale Normals\" by @RunDevelopment in #2500\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n* \"Execution Number\" node by @joeyballentine in #2433\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fix scale of Hq2X in output type by @RunDevelopment in #2467\r\n* Fix NCNN model interpolation execution context by @RunDevelopment in #2468\r\n* Fix accent color for `any` outputs by @RunDevelopment in #2479\r\n\r\n## Other/Dev Changes\r\n* ONNX upscale reworked by @adegerard in #2417\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.21.1...v0.21.2\n# Alpha v0.21.1\nThis update fixes a pretty crucial bug with upscaling images with transparency with PyTorch models.\r\n\r\nImportant note: I forgot to mention last update to make sure you have the latest Nvidia drivers after you update PyTorch. If your drivers haven't been updated in over a year, PyTorch upscaling might start not working or being extremely slow.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Better node errors using error messages in output types by @RunDevelopment in #2445\r\n* Add a popup message on start for dependency updates by @joeyballentine in #2453, #2458\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed upscaling with transparency by @RunDevelopment in #2457\r\n\r\n## Other/Dev Changes\r\n* Replace global execution options with node context parameter by @RunDevelopment in #2444\r\n* Use screenToFlowPosition() instead of project() by @joeyballentine in #2459\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.21.0...v0.21.1\n# Alpha v0.21.0\nThis might be chaiNNer's biggest update ever! Sorry for how long it took, we spent a lot of time making sure this release had the polish we deemed necessary. There are a lot of big changes in this update, but here are some highlights: Better iterators, general optimizations, support for more PyTorch models, chain auto-organization, and much more. Here are the major changes in greater detail:\r\n\r\n### Better Iterators\r\nThis might not be the final step in our goal of getting iteration in chaiNNer to where we want to be, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. Iterators are no longer gigantic nodes with their own sub-flow editor in them. Now, they are single nodes that can be attached like normal, which makes working with iteration a whole lot easier. Not only that, but it also allows mixing and matching iterators and \"collectors\", so now you can do things like convert an image sequence to a video, or split a spritesheet to separate images.\r\n\r\nHowever, only one iterator is actually allowed to be part of the same chain \"lineage\", so you still are not able to do things like match multiple iterators together or combine an image iterator and a model iterator. That is a lot more complex and will hopefully come in the future. Oh yeah, and all the iterator nodes have new names as well, so instead of \"Image File Iterator\", look for \"Load Images\".\r\n\r\n### General Optimizations\r\nWe spent some time working on optimizing a few aspects of chaiNNer and generally improving speed. From making PyTorch upscales faster to optimizing things like resizing to making the frontend use less CPU, you should notice a general speedup all around.\r\n\r\n### Support for more PyTorch models\r\nPart of what made this release take a while was that we took a small break from working on chaiNNer to separate out our model support code into a new Python package called [Spandrel](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/spandrel). Doing so allowed us to more easily add support for a variety of new models (such as SPAN, Real-CUGAN, FBCNN, and more) and we even got some contributions from the community. Spandrel is now being used in AUTOMATIC1111's stable diffusion webui, and will most likely also be used in ComfyUI soon. If you want chaiNNer's automatic model support in your Python project, go check out Spandrel. To see a list of all the currently supported models, check [here](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/spandrel/tree/v0.1.7?tab=readme-ov-file#model-architecture-support).\r\n\r\n### Other notable changes\r\n- Chains can now be auto-formatted/organized using Edit > Format Chain (or using ctrl+shift+f).\r\n- Upscale tiling is now even more seamless, using a blending technique to avoid hard seams with certain models like SCUNet.\r\n- Some general UI improvements and quality-of-life additions.\r\n- Many new nodes.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the changelog:\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n\r\n###

https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.20.2...v0.21.0\r\n\n# Alpha v0.20.2\nHey everyone, sorry it took so long to get this out. This update contains a bunch of things that I thought we had already released -- a couple bug fixes and some cool new features. Some very big things are on the way though, so be on the lookout for the next update.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add Multi Gaussian filter to Normal Map Generator (#2255)\r\n- Add ability to limit the length of certain iterators (#2218)\r\n- Add support for sub-pixel distance transform (#2235) \r\n- (ncnn) Allow disabling Winograd/SGEMM (for cpu ncnn) (#2237 -- thanks @JeremyRand) \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed being able to close the dependency manager while installing deps (#2227)\r\n- Fixed RGBA preview image background (#2225) \r\n- Fixed pip using bad caches on dep installs (#2232)\r\n- Fixed dragging bug on image previews (#2236)\r\n- Fixed bug from read-only image in CAS (#2239)\r\n- Fixed CAS for grayscale images (#2241)\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to these maintainers: @joeyballentine and @RunDevelopment \n# Alpha v0.20.1\nThis is a hotfix to fix the Windows installer installing to the wrong place. If you installed v0.20.0 on Windows, I recommend checking if your system registers two separate chaiNNer installs, and uninstalling the extra one after applying this update. If your system is not registering a second chaiNNer instance, I recommend navigating to `C:\\Users\\[your user]\\AppData\\Local` and seeing if a directory called `app` exists, and if it contains `chaiNNer.exe`. If it does, I recommend just deleting that `app` directory entirely. The v0.20.1 installer ***will not*** automatically fix this for you. I am very sorry for this inconvenience. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix windows installer installing to the wrong place (#2219)\r\n- Fix PyTorch erroring when both CPU and FP16 modes were enabled (#2217)\n# Alpha v0.20.0\nHey everyone! This is a pretty major update with some pretty overdue changes. The main big change is that we've upgraded to Python 3.11 (for integrated Python) as well as PyTorch 2.0 (if you're using chaiNNer for its PyTorch capabilities). Between these two changes, you should hopefully see a bit of an overall speed boost when processing things. That isn't all that got changed though, so take a look at the rest of the changelog to see everything that's new.\r\n\r\nNOTE: After installing v0.20.0, integrated Python will be redownloaded, and you will need to re-install any dependencies you are using from the dependency manager (assuming you are not using system Python). Also, dependency-related settings have been reset in this build, so make sure to double-check that everything looks correct)\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Update Integrated Python to Python 3.11 (#2144, #2092)\r\n- _View Image_ nodes now have resizable image previews (#2167, #2174, #2205, #2214)\r\n- Improved _Video Frame Iterator_ codec and container selection (#2158 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n- Add ability to pass custom additional ffmpeg params to _Video Frame Iterator_ (#2158 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n- MacOS builds are now code-signed (#2136, #2180 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n- MacOS builds are now universal (x64 and arm64) (#2162, #2166 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- (PyTorch) DAT and SRFormer support (#2153, #2155, #2156)\r\n- (PyTorch) Support for reading .ckpt files (for certain models) (#2193)\r\n- (PyTorch) Support for DiffBR's SwinIR models (#2202)\r\n- (PyTorch) FP16 now gets enabled by default for compatible GPUs (#2203)\r\n- Linux build improvements (#2179 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n- Wayland Linux support (#2178 -- thanks @illode)\r\n- Added BC5_SNORM format and additional format information to DDS options in _Save Image_ (#2199)\r\n- Added support for uncompressed DDS (#2201, #2211)\r\n- Performance improvement for iterator progress updates that should use less CPU and lag the UI less (#2182)\r\n- Visually show feature-disabled nodes as disabled (#2194)\r\n- Added docs for Mip options in _Save Image_ (#2207)\r\n- Added anti-aliasing to Threshold node (#2209)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Text as Image_ (#2125, #2213 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n    -

It's been a while since the last update, and in my opinion, it's been worth the wait. We have a lot of interesting improvements and new features to share with all of you.\r\n\r\nFirst, we now have documentation for all available nodes. This can be accessed both by a button in the top right button bar, as well as by right-clicking on a node in the sidebar and clicking \"Open Documentation\". The documentation includes a lot of information about nodes and their inputs & outputs. Not to mention, the docs are also searchable. This will hopefully be a huge help to both new and existing users.\r\n\r\nSecond, the update screen has finally received a makeover. This has been a long-overdue change. Starting with 0.19.0, you will get a popup when there is a new update, which will have an option for ignoring the update or viewing the update's changelog. If you view the changelog, a modal will open that will show you a full changelog of the update -- or multiple updates if you happen to be a few versions behind. From there you can view the release on GitHub or open chaiNNer.app to download it. If you do choose to ignore the update, don't worry, because you will see a green download indicator next to chaiNNer's version number which you can click on to view the update again.\r\n\r\nThird, we've made some improvements to how the backend sets up chaiNNer. This is mostly to prep for future features, but it also conveniently makes it slightly easier to set up chaiNNer on a remote machine, as all the necessary dependencies will be installed via the backend, instead of the frontend. This shouldn't affect existing users much, except you may notice that on starting up chaiNNer this time you see a slightly different progress indication on the splash screen as it installs the few new necessary dependencies. We also now bundle a couple of small, cross-platform dependencies that should make first-time setup a bit faster. If anyone is having trouble with the new first-time setup process, definitely let us know ASAP.\r\n\r\nFourth, chaiNNer is now taking advantage of some first-party Rust code. This means we were able to speed up certain nodes by a significant amount. Expect future updates to improve the speed of other nodes as we move some intensive operations over to Rust.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the changelog:\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Node Documentation (#1880, #1900, #1902, #1923, #1925, #1928, #1926, #1932, #1929, #1930, #1937, #1946, #1950, #1952, #1956, #1961, #1962, #1963, #1993, #1992, #1995, #2004, #2009, #2017)\r\n- Update checking improvement (#1935)\r\n- Mandatory dependencies now get installed via the backend (#1834, #1856, #1862, #1863, #1866, #1869, #1881, #1882, #1878, #1885, #1960)\r\n- New design for sliders (#1966, #1971, #1976, #1975, #1977, #1986, #1987, #1988)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n- Added Contrast-Adaptive-Sharpening to _High Boost Filter_ (#1841)\r\n- Added weight loading for NCNN Scale op and fix InnerProduct bug (#1864)\r\n- Use `chainner_ext` (rust code) for _Fill Alpha_ (#1865)\r\n- Added nearest color mode for Fill Alpha (#1883)\r\n- Allow color inputs in merge transparency (#1888)\r\n- Improved type error messages for colors (#1889)\r\n- Add a wcmatch.glob field to image iterator (#1840, #1939, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n- Hide unimportant labels (#1919)\r\n- Add more algorithms to the _Color Transfer_ node (#1903, thanks @adegerard)\r\n- Update pytorch model file input label (#1927)\r\n- Add window size detection to OmniSR (#1933)\r\n- Splash screen is no longer always on top (#1938)\r\n- Better computed alpha for upscaling nodes (#1942)\r\n- Move system stats to backend (#1948)\r\n- Changed empty-string behavior of text inputs (#1954)\r\n- Shorter names for channel inputs/outputs in Split/Merge Transparency (#1967)\r\n- Stack many images on _Stack_ node (#1972)\r\n- Consistently use sliders for blur radius-like number inputs (#1973, #1978)\r\n- Optimized box blur implementation (#1974)\r\n- Optimized Gaussian blur (#1981)\r\n- Input number on enter (#1982)\r\n- Variable precision for log-scale sliders (#1984) \r\n- Added context menu entry to extract value into node (#1985)\r\n- Added linked inputs group (implemented for _Box Blur_) (#1983)\r\n- Use slider in Gamma node (#1989)\r\n- Renamed \"LUT\" to \"color palette\" (#1991)\r\n- Simplified printed structs by omitting default fields (#2003)\r\n- Use a later version of pytorch that supports MPS for Arm MacOS (#2012)\r\n- Update ONNX + ONNXRuntime & Improvements for ONNX on MacOS (#2010)\r\n- Some UI fine-tuning around GPU selection on Mac (#2020, thanks @stonerl)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Image Statistic_ (#1748) \r\n    - A node to get the min, max, mean, media, n-th percentile of an image.\r\n- _Get Bounding Box_ (#1884, #1901, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n    - Like _Crop Content_ except it returns a bounding box insted of cropping.\r\n- _Regex Replace_ (#1893)\r\n    - Like _Text Replace_, but uses a regex search.\r\n- _Fast NL means_ (#1890, thanks @adegerard)\r\n    - Uses Fast NL means to denoise an image.\r\n- _Pick Color_ (#1913)\r\n    - Grab the color of a pixel in an image.\r\n- _Directory_ (#1921)\r\n    - Pick a directory and reuse it throughout the chain, like you can with numbers and strings currently.\r\n- _Switch_ (#1945)\r\n    - Connect multiple inputs and select which one you want to output.\r\n- _Stretch Contrast_ (#1959)\r\n    - Auto-levels-like functionality.

It _does_ still install, so just manually open it after.\r\n\r\nA huge requested feature is finally here! (well, kinda). Stable Diffusion support was something I've wanted to add for a while. However, I never thought I'd be able to match the experience from the AUTOMATIC1111 webui. Luckily for us, @adodge thought of a brilliant workaround for that: Just use the webui. Specifically, the webui's API. This way, we wouldn't have to set up any new dependencies or worry about integrating the code incorrectly -- it would just work. The only problem with this approach is it does require you to run the webui in api mode (by running `./webui.(sh|bat) --api` _before_ chaiNNer starts up. This will make a new category with the SD nodes appear. At the moment adodge is looking into an internal implementation, but for now this works pretty well.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of other new features in this update as well, such as inpainting support (both via opencv and LaMa), rembg support, a bunch of new nodes, and more. See the full changelog below:\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Stable Diffusion support via the AUTOMATIC1111 webui API (#1500, #1540, #1553, #1559, #1562, #1557, #1575, #1586, #1583 thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Adds Stable Diffusion support to chaiNNer by running the webui in API mode\r\n    - Supports Text-To-Image, Image-To-Image, Outpaining, and clip interrogation\r\n- Node recatigorization (#1576, #1581)\r\n- LaMa inpainting support (#1569)\r\n- RemBG background removal support (#1533)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- The external Stable Diffusion nodes mentioned above.\r\n- _Color Levels_ (#1532, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Color levels adjustment similar to Gimp and Photoshop.\r\n- _Dither_ & _Dither (Palette) (#1502, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Dither an image, either by number of colors or with a specified palette.\r\n- _Palette From Image_  (#1502, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Generates a palette from an image, to be used with dithering.\r\n- _Convert Normal Maps_\r\n    - Allows conversion between DirectX and OpenGL normal maps, as well as to and from the octahedral normal map format used by RTX Remix\r\n- _Inpaint_ (#1546, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Uses a mask image to inpaint. This is _not_ an AI inpainting node, but something more similar to content aware fill.\r\n- _Create Gradient_ (#1544, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Generates a grayscale gradient with a variety of options, which can then be colorized using the LUT node.\r\n- _Signed Distance Field_ (#1552, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Can be used to create low-resolution textures that can be scaled up rendered at a higher resolution with fewer artifacts.\r\n- _Dilate_ & _Erode_ (#1565, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - These two nodes work similarly to the dilate and erode features in Gimp and Blender.\r\n- (PyTorch) _Inpaint_ (#1569)\r\n    - Inpaint using the LaMa model, which performs significantly better than the opencv implementation used in the normal _Inpaint_ node.\r\n- (ONNX) _Remove Background_ (#1533)\r\n    - Remove the background of an image using .onnx RemBG models.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Added option to duplicate node with input connections (#1541)\r\n- Slightly improved type error messages (#1542, #1579)\r\n- Rearrange inputs on upscale nodes for consistency with other nodes (#1539, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n- Added \"export viewport to clipboard\" in the file menu (#1550)\r\n- Added more DDS output format options (#1555)\r\n- Added \"Copy Audio\" toggle for video iteration (#1563)\r\n- Added \"Use Pip Directly\" toggle in the dependency manager (#1560)\r\n- Changed the
