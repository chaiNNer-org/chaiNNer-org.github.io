It's been a while since the last update, and in my opinion, it's been worth the wait. We have a lot of interesting improvements and new features to share with all of you.\r\n\r\nFirst, we now have documentation for all available nodes. This can be accessed both by a button in the top right button bar, as well as by right-clicking on a node in the sidebar and clicking \"Open Documentation\". The documentation includes a lot of information about nodes and their inputs & outputs. Not to mention, the docs are also searchable. This will hopefully be a huge help to both new and existing users.\r\n\r\nSecond, the update screen has finally received a makeover. This has been a long-overdue change. Starting with 0.19.0, you will get a popup when there is a new update, which will have an option for ignoring the update or viewing the update's changelog. If you view the changelog, a modal will open that will show you a full changelog of the update -- or multiple updates if you happen to be a few versions behind. From there you can view the release on GitHub or open chaiNNer.app to download it. If you do choose to ignore the update, don't worry, because you will see a green download indicator next to chaiNNer's version number which you can click on to view the update again.\r\n\r\nThird, we've made some improvements to how the backend sets up chaiNNer. This is mostly to prep for future features, but it also conveniently makes it slightly easier to set up chaiNNer on a remote machine, as all the necessary dependencies will be installed via the backend, instead of the frontend. This shouldn't affect existing users much, except you may notice that on starting up chaiNNer this time you see a slightly different progress indication on the splash screen as it installs the few new necessary dependencies. We also now bundle a couple of small, cross-platform dependencies that should make first-time setup a bit faster. If anyone is having trouble with the new first-time setup process, definitely let us know ASAP.\r\n\r\nFourth, chaiNNer is now taking advantage of some first-party Rust code. This means we were able to speed up certain nodes by a significant amount. Expect future updates to improve the speed of other nodes as we move some intensive operations over to Rust.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the changelog:\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Node Documentation (#1880, #1900, #1902, #1923, #1925, #1928, #1926, #1932, #1929, #1930, #1937, #1946, #1950, #1952, #1956, #1961, #1962, #1963, #1993, #1992, #1995, #2004, #2009, #2017)\r\n- Update checking improvement (#1935)\r\n- Mandatory dependencies now get installed via the backend (#1834, #1856, #1862, #1863, #1866, #1869, #1881, #1882, #1878, #1885, #1960)\r\n- New design for sliders (#1966, #1971, #1976, #1975, #1977, #1986, #1987, #1988)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n- Added Contrast-Adaptive-Sharpening to _High Boost Filter_ (#1841)\r\n- Added weight loading for NCNN Scale op and fix InnerProduct bug (#1864)\r\n- Use `chainner_ext` (rust code) for _Fill Alpha_ (#1865)\r\n- Added nearest color mode for Fill Alpha (#1883)\r\n- Allow color inputs in merge transparency (#1888)\r\n- Improved type error messages for colors (#1889)\r\n- Add a wcmatch.glob field to image iterator (#1840, #1939, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n- Hide unimportant labels (#1919)\r\n- Add more algorithms to the _Color Transfer_ node (#1903, thanks @adegerard)\r\n- Update pytorch model file input label (#1927)\r\n- Add window size detection to OmniSR (#1933)\r\n- Splash screen is no longer always on top (#1938)\r\n- Better computed alpha for upscaling nodes (#1942)\r\n- Move system stats to backend (#1948)\r\n- Changed empty-string behavior of text inputs (#1954)\r\n- Shorter names for channel inputs/outputs in Split/Merge Transparency (#1967)\r\n- Stack many images on _Stack_ node (#1972)\r\n- Consistently use sliders for blur radius-like number inputs (#1973, #1978)\r\n- Optimized box blur implementation (#1974)\r\n- Optimized Gaussian blur (#1981)\r\n- Input number on enter (#1982)\r\n- Variable precision for log-scale sliders (#1984) \r\n- Added context menu entry to extract value into node (#1985)\r\n- Added linked inputs group (implemented for _Box Blur_) (#1983)\r\n- Use slider in Gamma node (#1989)\r\n- Renamed \"LUT\" to \"color palette\" (#1991)\r\n- Simplified printed structs by omitting default fields (#2003)\r\n- Use a later version of pytorch that supports MPS for Arm MacOS (#2012)\r\n- Update ONNX + ONNXRuntime & Improvements for ONNX on MacOS (#2010)\r\n- Some UI fine-tuning around GPU selection on Mac (#2020, thanks @stonerl)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Image Statistic_ (#1748) \r\n    - A node to get the min, max, mean, media, n-th percentile of an image.\r\n- _Get Bounding Box_ (#1884, #1901, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n    - Like _Crop Content_ except it returns a bounding box insted of cropping.\r\n- _Regex Replace_ (#1893)\r\n    - Like _Text Replace_, but uses a regex search.\r\n- _Fast NL means_ (#1890, thanks @adegerard)\r\n    - Uses Fast NL means to denoise an image.\r\n- _Pick Color_ (#1913)\r\n    - Grab the color of a pixel in an image.\r\n- _Directory_ (#1921)\r\n    - Pick a directory and reuse it throughout the chain, like you can with numbers and strings currently.\r\n- _Switch_ (#1945)\r\n    - Connect multiple inputs and select which one you want to output.\r\n- _Stretch Contrast_ (#1959)\r\n    - Auto-levels-like functionality.

I finally fixed the broken windows installer :)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed the windows installer not opening after install/update (#1830)\r\n- Fixed being unable to pass in electron-specific launch arguments to chaiNNer (#1830)\r\n- (unconfirmed) Fixed MacOS and Linux portable builds to be truly portable (#1829)\n# Alpha v0.18.8\nNote: this is another reminder that the windows installer doesn't open after installing. It's a known bug we haven't been able to fix \r\n\r\nAnother small update with some bug fixes and a couple of new features.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add FFv1 support to _Video Frame Iterator_ (#1779)\r\n- (onnx) Add FP16 option for tensorrt (#1795)\r\n- (pytorch) OmniSR Support (#1804, #1813, #1815)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Pixelate_ (#1777, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Pixelate an image, similar to Photoshop's \"Mosaic\" filter\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed bug with generating hashes after an upscale (#1797, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n- Fixed a bug that would show invalid nodes in the right-click node-selector context menu (#1821)\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks to the following maintainers: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment\n# Alpha v0.18.7\nThis is a small update with some new features and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Small performance optimizations (#1743)\r\n- Colors are now a data type and are selectable via color picker in many nodes (#1732)\r\n- Added missing previewing features on Text Areas (#1766)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Generate Hash_ (thanks @Zarxrax) (#1738)\r\n- _Z-Stack Images_ (thanks @JustNoon) (#1745)\r\n- (webui integration) _Image Upscale_ (thanks @mateusz) (#1692)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- (webui integration) fixed caching not respecting image changes (#1762)\r\n- Fixed _Fill Alpha_ causing errors in certain chains (#1768)\r\n- Fixed iterators not properly catching certain types of errors (#1771)\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to the maintainers who contributed to this release: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment\n# Alpha v0.18.6\nThis is a slightly bigger update that didn't quite qualify for a major version number.

It _does_ still install, so just manually open it after.\r\n\r\nA huge requested feature is finally here! (well, kinda). Stable Diffusion support was something I've wanted to add for a while. However, I never thought I'd be able to match the experience from the AUTOMATIC1111 webui. Luckily for us, @adodge thought of a brilliant workaround for that: Just use the webui. Specifically, the webui's API. This way, we wouldn't have to set up any new dependencies or worry about integrating the code incorrectly -- it would just work. The only problem with this approach is it does require you to run the webui in api mode (by running `./webui.(sh|bat) --api` _before_ chaiNNer starts up. This will make a new category with the SD nodes appear. At the moment adodge is looking into an internal implementation, but for now this works pretty well.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of other new features in this update as well, such as inpainting support (both via opencv and LaMa), rembg support, a bunch of new nodes, and more. See the full changelog below:\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Stable Diffusion support via the AUTOMATIC1111 webui API (#1500, #1540, #1553, #1559, #1562, #1557, #1575, #1586, #1583 thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Adds Stable Diffusion support to chaiNNer by running the webui in API mode\r\n    - Supports Text-To-Image, Image-To-Image, Outpaining, and clip interrogation\r\n- Node recatigorization (#1576, #1581)\r\n- LaMa inpainting support (#1569)\r\n- RemBG background removal support (#1533)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- The external Stable Diffusion nodes mentioned above.\r\n- _Color Levels_ (#1532, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Color levels adjustment similar to Gimp and Photoshop.\r\n- _Dither_ & _Dither (Palette) (#1502, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Dither an image, either by number of colors or with a specified palette.\r\n- _Palette From Image_  (#1502, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Generates a palette from an image, to be used with dithering.\r\n- _Convert Normal Maps_\r\n    - Allows conversion between DirectX and OpenGL normal maps, as well as to and from the octahedral normal map format used by RTX Remix\r\n- _Inpaint_ (#1546, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Uses a mask image to inpaint. This is _not_ an AI inpainting node, but something more similar to content aware fill.\r\n- _Create Gradient_ (#1544, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Generates a grayscale gradient with a variety of options, which can then be colorized using the LUT node.\r\n- _Signed Distance Field_ (#1552, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Can be used to create low-resolution textures that can be scaled up rendered at a higher resolution with fewer artifacts.\r\n- _Dilate_ & _Erode_ (#1565, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - These two nodes work similarly to the dilate and erode features in Gimp and Blender.\r\n- (PyTorch) _Inpaint_ (#1569)\r\n    - Inpaint using the LaMa model, which performs significantly better than the opencv implementation used in the normal _Inpaint_ node.\r\n- (ONNX) _Remove Background_ (#1533)\r\n    - Remove the background of an image using .onnx RemBG models.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Added option to duplicate node with input connections (#1541)\r\n- Slightly improved type error messages (#1542, #1579)\r\n- Rearrange inputs on upscale nodes for consistency with other nodes (#1539, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n- Added \"export viewport to clipboard\" in the file menu (#1550)\r\n- Added more DDS output format options (#1555)\r\n- Added \"Copy Audio\" toggle for video iteration (#1563)\r\n- Added \"Use Pip Directly\" toggle in the dependency manager (#1560)\r\n- Changed the design of resize handles (#1584)\r\n- Create node on enter in search pane, when only one node is an option (#1578)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed the bug that would cause TextAreas (like what is used in the _Note_ node) to randomly get much larger (#1582)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, thanks to the maintainers: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni \n# Alpha v0.17.1\nNOTE: As a reminder, the windows installer still does not open after installing anymore. It still does install though, so just manually open it after installation. We are actively investigating why this happened.\r\n\r\nThis update includes some new nodes, a quality-of-life improvement related to stopping execution, even _more_ portability, and a bit more. See the full changelog below: \r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Long-running upscales can now be stopped, without chaiNNer seeming to hang (#1521)\r\n- Added DDS option for separating alpha (#1510)\r\n- Slight styling changes for slider input numbers (#1504)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Random Number_ (#1499, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n    - Allows using a randomly generated number for number inputs\r\n- NCNN Model File Iterator\r\n    - Similar to the PyTorch model file iterator, these allow you to iterate over folders of NCNN models.\r\n- ONNX Model File Iterator\r\n    - Ditto above, but for ONNX\r\n- _Lens Blur_ (#1516, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Applies lens blur to an image\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed RGBA DDS loading (#1514)\r\n- Fixed chaiNNer closing when visiting the update link, or dismissing the box (#1518)\r\n- Fixed some missing portability when using a portable zip (#1523, #1530)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, thanks @joeyballentine and @RunDevelopment \n# Alpha v0.17.0\nNOTE: with this release it seems chaiNNer no long automatically opens after installing an update -- don't worry though, the installer still works.\r\n\r\nThis update adds a few somewhat important dependency updates for system compatibility reasons, as well as a few major new features, and lots of minor ones. \r\n\r\nI'll keep this brief this time, and just have you read the changelog below:\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n- ONNX -> 1.13\r\n    - With this update, ARM (M1/M2) MacOS users can now use ONNX, since this update provides an arm64 MacOS version. This means you can properly convert to NCNN through ONNX.\r\n- OpenCV -> 4.7 (automatic)\r\n    - Usually I don't mention dependencies that update automatically, but I wanted to mention this one specifically -- because now we should theoretically support MacOS versions under 10.15, specifically to 10.13 now. This has not been officially tested by us, but it _should_ work. We probably scared away all the < 10.15 people by now, but if any of you see this, please give it a try now.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- CLI Mode (#1469, #1470, #1468, #1489, #1492, #1494)\r\n    - This was our first-ever commissioned feature, so thanks to Flaviu Radulescu for funding this feature.\r\n    - This feature now allows you to execute chains from the command-line, without needing the GUI to run. This includes being able to override inputs for easier chain reuse.\r\n    - Documentation can be found by running `chainner run --help` in the command line.\r\n- True portability for zip builds (#1484, #1487, #1489)\r\n    - ZIP builds were never truly portable as integrated python, settings, and a few other things were saved to appdata. Now, these will download & save to the root directory of the exe.\r\n    - If you don't want this functionality, simply delete the `portable` file that is now present in the zip builds.\r\n- Improved startup speed (#1468)\r\n    - chaiNNer now starts up significantly faster than it used to (assuming it has already gone through first-time setup and updates)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Image Convolve_ (#1442, thanks @JumpyJacko)\r\n    - Runs arbitrary convolution with a user-defined kernel\r\n- _Metal to Specular_ & _Specular to Metal_ (#1457)\r\n    - Converts metal/specular maps to specular/metal maps\r\n- _Number_ & _Text_\r\n    - These nodes allow easy re-use of numbers or text between nodes\r\n- _Apply LUT_\r\n    - You can now apply a Look-Up Table (LUT) to images\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Support for mode DDS formats (#1471)\r\n    - This is specifically DXT1, DXT3, and DXT5. This is still a Windows-only feature.\r\n- Improved JPEG saving options (#1480, #1483)\r\n    - This includes adding a chroma subsampling dropdown as well as a \"progressive\" option\r\n- Allow dragging videos into chaiNNer for loading like images/models (#1488)\r\n- Enhanced type tag size (#1404, #1478)\r\n- Added output alpha option to _Change Colorspace_ (#1405)\r\n- Made directory and file name output types immediately computed (#1408)\r\n- Added angle addition method for normal maps (#1409)\r\n- Better error message when loading a PyTorch model fails (#1433)\r\n- Add seed input to _Add Noise_ node (#1444)\r\n- Made the output type for _Math_ node a bit better (#1452)\r\n- Improved some type error messages (#1493)\r\n- Improved logging (#1495)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed a small issue with number input width (#1443)\r\n- Fixed potential errors caused by manually clearing PyTorch memory during out-of-vram events (#1456)\r\n\r\nAnd as always thanks to the maintainers: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni\n# Alpha v0.16.1\nThis is just a minor update which includes a couple of fixes and QOL improvements. Make sure to check last version's changelog if you haven't grabbed that version yet.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Better execution time formatting (#1392, #1394)\r\n- Increase default codeformer weight to 0.7 (#1381)\r\n- Replaced some true/false dropdown inputs with checkboxes (#1377)\r\n- Changed max of _Add Normals_ amount to 200% (#1398)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Made text of dropdown options larger (#1375)\r\n- Fixed DDS rename not working across drives (#1376)\r\n- Removed broken window menu from menu bar (#1386)\r\n- Fixed some errors not showing in the UI (#1407)\r\n\r\nAs always thanks to @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment and @theflyingzamboni for contributing to this release.\n# Alpha v0.16.0\nThis is a pretty big update with some noticeable changes and improvements, including a design overhaul and many quality-of-life features.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n\r\n- Major UI improvements (#1305, #1326, #1302, #1313, #1314, #1330, #1340)\r\n\r\n    - The first thing you might notice in this version is a bit of a redesign. Nodes have been majorly overhauled to be much more compact. While it might be a bit of a shock how different it looks at first, I guarantee you'll quickly get used to it and prefer this new look. The compactness of the nodes gives you much more space to fill out your chains with, and there is just a lot less wasted space overall. Check out [this comparison of the space used by the old vs the new nodes](https://imgsli.com/MTM4NDgy)  \r\n    - With this compactness change also came a change to sliders. In my opinion, they are now a lot easier to see and interact with, and are closer to something like you'd see in blender.  \r\n    - There have also been changes to pop-up boxes. Settings had a bit of an overhaul to fix some scrolling issues, and all pop-ups now have a darker color. Alerts also got icons representing the type of alert.  \r\n\r\n- Node-on-Connection insertion (#1231, #1341)\r\n\r\n    - Something we all have always wanted in chaiNNer was the ability to insert a compatible node in-between two connected nodes, without having to delete the connection and make two new ones. Well, now this is a reality. All you have to do is hold `alt` while dragging a node in the editor, and both the node and the connection line will visually show you that the node is able to be connected this way. It's really convenient to be able to insert nodes into existing chains this way, and can save a lot of time.\r\n\r\n- Informing you about invalid connections (#1299, #1306, #1308)\r\n\r\n    - The UI now will inform you when a connection you are trying to make is invalid. Before, we would tell you why a node was invalid _after_ it was already connected and then made invalid. However, we had never explained why some connections were not possible to begin with. This had confused many users as they would try to do things like connect a GFPGAN model to _Upscale Image_ and think there was something wrong rather than it being something intentional. While the UI would not let these users make that connection, it would not tell them _why_. This update adds an explanation tooltip that explains why a connection can't be made as you attempt to drop the connection on a handle. This should hopefully improve the user experience and lead to less confusion when this happens.\r\n\r\n- Increased _View Image_ preview resolution (#1290, #1342, #1351)\r\n\r\n    - _View Image_ just became a lot more useful. Now, instead of seeing only a 512x512 preview of your image, you will see a maximum of 2K resolution when zoomed in to the max. This still isn't ideal for extremely large images (larger than 2k) where you need to zoom in even more than chaiNNer allows, but a feature for that will be coming in the future. For now, this is a huge improvement and makes in-line previewing much much better. We also improved the performance of the node, so you may notice previews loading a bit faster than they used to.\r\n\r\n- Better DDS Support (Reading & writing, Windows only) (#1266, #1356)\r\n\r\n    - With this update, previously unsupported DDS textures files can now be read and written on Windows. We make use of Texconv, which is a small texture utility that we now bundle with chaiNNer. Unfortunately, Textconv is Windows-only, meaning Linux & MacOS users will not be able to take advantage of this. But we figured it was still better to have it than not.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n- CodeFormer support (#1327)\r\n  - This Face Upscaling architecture was highly requested to be added, and now you can use it in chaiNNer with the Face Upscale node.\r\n- NCNN Optimizer (#1259)\r\n  - NCNN models now get optimized on load as well as on convert, which can save help them save a little bit of time when upscaling. For most models, this will only be minute optimizations, but for batch upscaling it can save quite a lot of time overall.\r\n- Show current overall execution progress on taskbar (#1343, #1365)\r\n- Made amount input a slider in _High Boost Filter_ (#1288)\r\n- Added amount and threshold inputs for _Unsharp Mask_ (#1293, #1294)\r\n- Added the ability to cache ONNX TensorRT conversions (#1287)\r\n- Added a context menu for multi-node selections (#1289)\r\n- Added Ko-fi donation button to header (#1300)\r\n- Improved _Convert Colorspace_ node to be more generalized for alpha modes (#1322)\r\n- Add .avs support to the video selection menu (#1345)\r\n- Allow users to select alert text (#1349)\r\n- Support node-search context menu in iterators (#1369)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n\r\n- _Create Color_ (#1285)\r\n  - Three new nodes that allow you to create single-color images in RGB, RGBA, or Grayscale.\r\n- _Surface Blur_ (#1292)\r\n  - This node blurs an image using a bilateral blur filter, also known as \"surface blur.\"\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed picking a custom python path (#1283, #1284, #1315)\r\n- Fixed FaceSR (GFPGAN, RestoreFormer) and Transformer-model (SwinIR, HAT, Swin2SR) interpolation (#1281)\r\n- Fixed the file select window prompting you to create files when opening directories that do not exist (#1282)\r\n- Fixed the integrated FFMPEG download error to just be a warning (#1279)\r\n- Fixed blurry checkers in image preview (#1320)\r\n- Fixed being able to select text in file and directory inputs (#1331)\r\n- Fixed opening a file with chaiNNer while an existing chaiNNer instance is already open (#1344)\r\n- Fixed exact-size ONNX models not being properly run (#1336)\r\n- Disallow negative crop values (#1350)\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- While not enabled/disable behind the experimental features setting, both Apple MPS (via pytorch-nightly) and Microsoft DML (via pytorch-directml) support should _theoretically_ work with a proper environment set up through your system python. People who have tried to set this up have had issues though, and ultimately I need more people to test this before I can officially say we support these things. However, if you want to test it yourself and know how to set these things up, feel free to give it a go and report back to us. (#1280, #1359)\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks to @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment and @theflyingzamboni\r\n\n# Alpha v0.15.3\nTheoretically, all model loading should now be fixed. However, if you are still running into models that previously worked but are now broken, let us know ASAP.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed another missing torch type when loading a model, which caused certain models to not load properly (#1272)\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n- Fixed iterator child node positions when placing presets (#1264)\r\n- Fixed presets not being recorded in undo history properly (#1270)\n# Alpha v0.15.2\nJust a quick bugfix since we accidentally broke loading certain models in the last release. You don't really need this version unless you plan on using SwinIR, Swin2SR, or HAT. To see the previous changelog, [go here](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/releases/tag/v0.15.1).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed model loading for certain models being blocked by the new restricted loader (#1263)\r\n\r\nThanks @theflyingzamboni for fixing that\n# Alpha v0.15.1\n## Major Changes\r\n- Viewport Export (#1243) (thanks @Sryvkver)\r\n    - Export the current chain as a PNG using the bottom-most button in the button panel located at the bottom left of the chain editor.\r\n- Ctrl+D now duplicates selected nodes (#1252)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Added a context menu for connections (#1255)\r\n- Blur and sharpen nodes have been reorganized and renamed (#1254)\r\n- Iterators now have a \"resize\" indicator (#1257)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Add Noise_ (#1251)\r\n    - Add different types of noise to an image\r\n- _High Boost Filter_ (#1254)\r\n    - A more traditional type of sharpening\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed face upscaling causing broken video outputs (#1246)\r\n- Fixed unsaved changes dialog box having extraneous &s on Linux (#1249)\r\n- Fixed categories not hiding when a search would return no results for that category (#1253)\r\n- Patched a security vulnerability\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to the usual contributors, @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni \n# Alpha v0.15.0\nThis update contains a decent amount of quality-of-life changes. We have some new systems in place for making the experiences with inputs better (which will be brought to more nodes in the future), as well as some general UX improvements.\r\n\r\nWe also now have an opt-in experimental features setting that we are starting to use in order to get feedback on unfinished features, but without interrupting the regular experience of chaiNNer.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Variable-length inputs (#1176, #1184)\r\n    - Now certain nodes can have more than just 4 inputs, with a button that lets you add more. \r\n    - This is limited to just _Text Append_ and _Text Pattern_ at the moment, but will be brought to more nodes in the future.\r\n- Conditional inputs (#1200)\r\n    - Now certain nodes can show or hide some inputs based on things like items selected in a dropdown.\r\n    - This is currently only present in the _Save Image_ node, but will probably be used with more nodes in the future.\r\n- Experimental Features Toggle (#1142)\r\n    - We now have a setting (in the advanced tab) for turning on \"experimental features\". This will opt you into using anything we deem \"experimental\" that is in chaiNNer but not quite ready for prime-time. I will list anything new that is experimental under a new Experimental Features heading in the changelog.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Drag N' Drop support for more filetypes (#1215)\r\n    - This mainly includes all model file types (.pth, .param/.bin, .onnx)\r\n- Added \"WEBP (Lossless)\" option to _Save Image_ (#1186)\r\n    - We had previously accidentally made it impossible to save lossless WEBP, and now you can\r\n- Better \"Save Changes\" popup (#1191)\r\n    - The \"Save Changes\" dialog box that appears when you try to quit with unsaved changes is now a more standard format, with \"Save\", \"Don't Save\", and \"Cancel\" options.\r\n- Show the current position of alerts in the alert box queue (#1193)\r\n- Added menu entry for manually reloading/refreshing starting nodes and their previews (#1194)\r\n- Added \"Copy to clipboard\" button for all alerts (#1203)\r\n- Added type tags to strings and directories (#1216, #1226, #1244)\r\n- Changed placeholder text on some inputs (#1223)\r\n- Added custom installation animation on Windows (#1230)\r\n- Moved update check to after the main window opens (#1232)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Normal Map Generator_ (#1181, #1208)\r\n    - Generate Normal Maps from images, with a variety of customization options similar to Nvidia Texture Tool\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n- Presets (#1142, #1240, #1241)\r\n    - We now have some built-in bundles of nodes that we figure could be useful for setting up a variety of chains. However, they are not what we would consider feature complete yet (hence why they are behind the experimental features toggle). We would like to hear feedback from users as to what they think would be helpful (for example, clusters of nodes they tend to use all the time) and we can change/add presets accordingly. There is also still a lot of UI to be done around these, but they are at least usable at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed being unable to read MKV video duration (#1189)\r\n- Fixed saving as GIF in _Save Image_ (#1201)\r\n- Fixed pressing arrow keys inside text and number inputs moving nodes around (#1205, #1212)\r\n- Fixed FP mode not being loaded correctly for NCNN (#1210)\r\n- Disable shortcuts while alerts are open (#1214)\r\n- Fixed clear not affecting text inputs (#1217)\r\n- Fixed iterator helper node type persistence (#1222)\r\n- Reset invalid dropdown values (#1227)\r\n- Fixed supported video format list in file open window (#1242)\r\n\r\nThanks as always to the main contributors: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni \n# Alpha v0.14.2\n## New Features\r\n- HAT Support (#1169, #1172, #1173)\r\n    - Adds the HAT architecture, which is another improvement on SwinIR\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n- Offset image preview nodes created by the shortcut button based on output index (#1178)\r\n- Prevent FaceSR models from being converted to ONNX & NCNN due to being incompatible (#1136, #1174)\r\n- Calculate number of frames estimate when nb_frames data is unavailable on video (#1136)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed issue where entire video would attempt to be processed when an error occurs (#1136)\r\n- Fixed Swin2SR \"compression\" model loading (#1171)\r\n- Fixed improper fp16 ONNX to NCNN conversion (#1162)\r\n- Fixed slider value resetting visually but not actually on double-click (#1179)\r\n- Fixed _Split Transparency_ erroring when inputting grayscale images (#1182)\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks to everyone who contributed to this release: @joeyballentine @RunDEvelopment @theflyingzamboni \n# Alpha v0.14.1\nThis is a small update that fixes a few bugs and adds a few things as well.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Swin2SR Model Support (#1158)\r\n    - The successor to SwinIR now works in chaiNNer!\r\n- _Image Pairs Iterator_ Node (#1157)\r\n    - A highly requested feature: being able to iterate two paired directories, for things like already upscaled image comparisons. Limited to only two directories at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n- Added handle to Write Output Frame directory input (#1163)\r\n- Improved _Change Colorspace_'s inputs (#1139)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed rounding inconsistency between backend and type hints (#1161)\r\n- Added proper error message for libx264 failures in the _Video Frame Iterator_ and made it stop immediately after an error (#1163) \r\n\r\nThanks to everyone involved with this release: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni\n# Alpha v0.14.0\nAfter a long wait, 0.14.0 is finally here. This update brings a couple of pretty important changes. \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes is improved video support. Many of you have found that the current video support isn't great, as it has limited encoding options which tend to not work depending on the machine. This is due to how OpenCV's video support works (or I guess, doesn't work), which I won't go into detail about here. As of this update, the video support has been revamped to use a fully-featured FFMPEG build. This means that now we are able to have many more encoding options compared to before, so it gives you a lot more flexibility. It also means that it's pretty much guaranteed to work on any system now. This is a huge improvement that is long overdue.\r\n\r\nAnother long overdue change is a revamp of how auto-tiling works. For a long time, chaiNNer hid tiling options from users, and just automatically handled it behind the scenes. If you don't know, tiling is something that many upscaling applications implement to get around VRAM limitations when an upscale would use more VRAM than your GPU physically has. We eventually decided to expose manual tiling options to the users, but this still used our internal \"split factor\" system, leading to the option being called \"number of tiles\". This was temporary but stuck around longer than we thought it would, and it rightfully confused users.\r\n\r\nThanks to @RunDevelopment's tiling changes, we now have a similar but much better implementation that uses actual tile sizes. This is much more in line with other upscaling applications and is a bit easier to comprehend and plan around. We also have more options in the dropdown, as well as new VRAM estimation for NCNN. You'll see this as \"Auto (estimate)\" and \"Maximum\". Picking \"Maximum\" will function similarly to how it did previously, while \"Auto\" will function by pre-determining a tile size to use based on available VRAM. PyTorch has been using this method for a while, but now NCNN has it as well. And of course, now we have better options for picking actual tile sizes, meaning you can use the same tile size on multiple images and not have to worry about changing it all the time (if you need to set it manually, that is). We still generally recommend you use the Auto or Maximum modes though. \r\n\r\nThere's also a lot more in this update, so check out the full changelog below.\r\n\r\n## New Features / Major Changes\r\n- Proper \"Tile Size\" setting on upscale nodes (#1056, #1060, #1095, #1112, #1115)\r\n    - This replaces the \"Number of Tiles\" dropdown\r\n- VRAM estimation for NCNN (#1068)\r\n    - Similar to how PyTorch has been for a while, Auto mode now pre-estimates the required tile size based on available VRAM instead of auto-splitting.\r\n    - This should hopefully cut down on the amount of vkQueueSubmit errors, since now we theoretically should prevent out-of-memory errors from happening.\r\n- Better video support in _Video Frame Iterator_ (#1103, #1108, #1110, #1113, #1123)\r\n    - We are now using a proper FFMPEG build to handle video iteration. This means we have unlocked far more encoding settings to make available for you to use, plus added stability.\r\n- Paste image from clipboard directly into chaiNNer (#1102) \r\n- Compression option for saving an image as JPEG or WEBP (#1126)\r\n- Added NCNN model preview and type information to the _Load Model_ node, similar to PyTorch (#1124, #1133, #1147)\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n- Added Lightness slider to _Hue & Saturation_ node (#1080)\r\n- Changed how brightness in _Brightness & Contrast_ node works (#1081)\r\n- Improved the internal Nvidia GPU check (#1083)\r\n- Changed how _Change Colorspace_ defines \"from\" and \"to\" values (#1089, #1138)\r\n- More blend modes (#1072)\r\n- Added HSL and CMYK to _Change Colorspace_ (#1068)\r\n- Double-click a slider to reset its value (#1097)\r\n- Renamed \"Amount\" to \"Radius\" for all blurs (#1098)\r\n- Slightly improved logging to reduce both spam and user confusion (#1116)\r\n- Adjusted PyTorch's VRAM estimation values tio allow more VRAM use at once (#1120)\r\n- Improved _Text Append_ default values and made separator optional (#1125)\r\n- Improved some error messages (#1121, #1134, #1137, #1141)\r\n- Allow middle-click panning, even over nodes (#1063)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Text Padding_\r\n    - Add padding to any text or number, mainly for formatting numbers to a specific number of characters (such as converting \"2\" into \"000002\")\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Improved output type for crop content node (#1066)\r\n- Fixed light theme issue on node timers (#1119)\r\n- Fixed bugs that allowed improper cross-iterator connections (#1128)\r\n- Fixed copying grayscale images (#1132)\r\n- Prevented some crashing when certain node import errors occur (#1135)\r\n- Fixed image iterator improperly sorting lower/uppercase (#1144, #1145)\r\n- Made _Sharpen_ consistent with blur nodes (#1150)\r\n\r\nPS, we also now have nightly builds, which you can find [here](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer-nightly/releases). Feel free to try these at any time to test out the newest features ahead of release.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks to the main contributors: @joeyballentine, @RunDevelopment, @theflyingzamboni\n# Alpha v0.13.1\nSorry for the delay in updates. The initial plan was to release a smaller update soon after 0.13.0 got released, but we ended up delaying it due to some issues with some upcoming things we merged. Those features will be out eventually, but for now I figured I'd release this small patch update with a few changes/bugfixes.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Node categories will now display an indicator if any nodes in that category are missing, and will let you know there are extra dependencies you need to download. We had something similar before, but this is much more robust. For example, it should be much more obvious now when you are missing the newer torchvision & facexlib dependencies. (#1047)\r\n- The utility category is now above PyTorch/NCNN/ONNX, at the very bottom of the \"built-in\" nodes (that do not require extra dependencies), so don't be alarmed if you don't see it in its usual spot. (#1051)\r\n- Added video name and directory to _Video Frame Iterator_ (#1050)\r\n- Connections can now be removed with a double click (#1055)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- Fixes an issue where some nodes would throw an error if used directly after upscaling a grayscale image (#1070)\n# Alpha v0.13.0\nBefore we begin, you might notice chaiNNer has a new home! This repository now lives in an organization (chaiNNer-org) rather than my personal GitHub account. This means that the URL to the repository is now https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer. The old one should still redirect here though, but you should update any links you have (in descriptions, tutorials, etc) just in case.\r\n\r\nThis update brings a long-awaited addition: GFPGAN support! Luckily, we were able to add this without much hassle. However, it does not support the first v1 GFPGAN model (but it does support v1.2+). This is because GFPGAN v1 requires compiled CUDA extensions, which is not simple to support at this time. The good news is, the later models are much better anyway, so you are better off using those to begin with. GFPGAN support does require installing a new dependency package from the dependency manager, facexlib (as part of the PyTorch package collection), so make sure you do that!\r\n\r\nTo use GFPGAN with chaiNNer, there is now a new node: _Face Upscale_. You pass the loaded model into this node, and can optionally pass in an upscaled version of the background as well. This allows you to fully customize the background upscale, unlike the official GFPGAN code which only allows you to upscale with RealESRGAN at a fixed scale. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of scale, I did add an additional scale option for the GFPGAN output. While GFPGAN internally always does an 8x upscale, the official code as well as existing GUIs have included an output scale option (which just downscales the result). To ease confusion from people expecting this, I just decided to implement this as well. Unlike these other implementations though, the scale can be any number between 1 and 8, instead of just powers of 2. The important thing to keep in mind here is that adjusting the scale _DOES NOT_ make it actually process with lower VRAM or anything like that.\r\n\r\nAnother important note: The first time you use GFPGAN, facexlib will automatically download some necessary models to <appdata>/chaiNNer/python/gfpgan. This only happens for the first use, and depending on your internet speed might take a while. Just let it download and once finished everything should work fine.\r\n\r\nFor everything else about this release, see this full changelog:\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- GFPGAN (Face Upscaling/Restoration) support (#999) (#1018)\r\n    - GFPGAN (as well as RestoreFormer) have been added to chaiNNer. Once loaded just like regular models, these models can be used with the _Face Upscale_ node.\r\n- Dependency Manager improvements (#990)\r\n    - The dependency manager now shows exactly which packages are installed, missing, and out of date.\r\n    - Each dependency now has a description associated with it.\r\n- TGA saving support (#1033) (thanks @emarron)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Pass Through_ Node (#968)\r\n    - This node simply passes the input value through to the output.\r\n    - This is useful if you want to have one output connection go to multiple inputs, but also want to be able to easily swap what node gives that input.\r\n- _Create Edges_ Node (#1009)\r\n    - Like a cross between _Create Border_ and _Crop (Edges)_, this node creates a border around the image, but using adjustable numbers for each side.\r\n- _Face Upscale_ (#999)\r\n    - Used for processing with GFPGAN and RestoreFormer.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n- Removed Discord Rich-Presence (#1038)\r\n    - This will eventually be added back, but for now it has been removed. It has come to our attention that it sometimes causes chaiNNer to not start up, and when it does work it leaks the name of chain files. While we work on resolving these issues, the feature has been temporarily removed.\r\n- _Blend Image_ optimizations (#989)\r\n    - Should see significantly better performance with this node, under certain circumstances.\r\n- Added timer support for iterators (#1021)\r\n- Various crop node improvements (#1013)\r\n- Changed input name for converted ONNX models to allow them to be compatible with VSGAN-tensorrt-docker (#1006)\r\n- Rename \"relative path\" to \"subdirectory path\" to make its use-case more obvious (#1022)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes:\r\n- Drastically fixed NCNN performance in iterators by only loading model once (#1023)\r\n- Fixed FPS values for videos (via the _Video Frame Iterator_) getting rounded in the output (#987)\r\n- Fixed _Fill Alpha_ node (#992)\r\n- Fixed _Canny Edge Detection_ node (#1010)\r\n- Fixed image iterator sorting (#1004)\r\n- Fixed output type of _Text Pattern_ node (#1012)\r\n- Fixed output type of _Crop (Border)_ node (#1013)\r\n- Fixed Linux bug due to missing qt environment variable (#1016)\r\n- Fixed pixelunshuffle ESRGAN models (RealESRGANx2 mainly) erroring due to uneven image sizes (#1017)\r\n- Show correct install size when only some packages are installed in the dependency manager (#1030)\r\n\r\nThanks to @RunDevelopment and @theflyingzamboni for their various contributions as always.\n# Alpha v0.12.7\nAnother minor release that fixes some bugs and makes a couple of changes.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix ONNX node issues (#970) (#980)\r\n    - Mainly, fixed _Convert to ONNX_ being broken.\r\n- Lower max PyTorch VRAM amount again (#981)\r\n    - There have been some reports that the increased VRAM is making it actually slower overall, so this brings it back down closer to what it was originally. \r\n- Clear chaiNNer's internal cache when a node gets cleared (#978)\r\n- Fixed starting nodes not running after clearing (#974)\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n- Improve the update check on startup (#971)\r\n    - From now on, the update checker will give a list of the main changes as well as tell you your current version, rather than only telling you that an update is available.\r\n- Pre-optimize ONNX models via constant folding on convert from PyTorch (#969)\r\n- Shorter type error messages (#975)\n# Alpha v0.12.6\nThis hotfix update attempts to fix a few issues reported in the last update. Apologies to anyone affected by these things.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix pasteboard install on M1 macOS causing crash on startup (#963)\r\n    - We did not realize after adding a new required dependency for the _Copy to Clipboard_ node that the pasteboard package is only built for x64 macOS. I'm working out how to add support for pre-built arm64 wheels, but for now pasteboard just won't try to install on M1. This means copy to clipboard won't work on that platform while we work this out.\r\n- ~~Fix PyTorch's _Convert to ONNX_ node (#962)~~\r\n    - ~~This node was accidentally not updated after a separate ONNX fix, and therefore connecting the resulting model to any of the ONNX inputs caused an error. This has been resolved~~\r\n    - This was discovered to still have an issue. Working on it now.\r\n- Fixed _Shift_ node output typing (#966) (thanks @RunDevelopment)\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n- Better generated error reports (#957) (thanks @RunDevelopment)\r\n    - Generates better error reports when a crash happens in the main process. This is more of a helpful feature for us devs rather than for the end user.\r\n- Lower VRAM cap slightly (#967)\r\n    - Got a report saying PyTorch was hogging more VRAM than it should have been, so I've decreased the value I increased last update. It's still more than it was in 0.12.4, but hopefully now it's at just the right place for a balance of optimal performance and stability.\n# Alpha v0.12.5\nThis update adds a few improvements as well as some extra features.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm not sure about is if I fixed a common NCNN issue. Please let me know if this solves any of your previous issues, if you had any.\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n- NCNN\r\n    - NCNN now auto updates if installed, so you don't have to update it manually anymore. This will ensure that any changes I make to the NCNN bindings will not cause chaiNNer to suddenly stop working due to outdated NCNN.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Add ONNX execution options to settings (#931)\r\n    - This allows you to select a GPU to use for ONNX processing, as well as picking an execution engine. If you have TensorRT set up properly on your system, this also means you can select TensorRT. This should theoretically give you much faster speeds when doing batch processing (just make sure to put the load model node outside the iterator. TensorRT takes a _long_ time to convert the model to an engine)\r\n- Reporting all type mismatches (#939) (thanks @RunDevelopment)\r\n    - We will now warn you if nodes that were previously compatible have suddenly become incompatible due to an upstream change, even if no custom error message has been set.\r\n- \"Soft light\" blend mode (#941) (thanks @JustNoon)\r\n    - This is a new blend mode in the _Blend Images_ node\r\n- Show proper error message on integrated python download failure (#949) (thanks @RunDevelopment)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Copy To Clipboard_ (#920) (thanks @Sryvkver)\r\n    - This node allows copying an image, text, or number to the clipboard. You can find it in the utilities section.\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n- Instead of attempting to update the required dependencies every startup, it will now do so only when needed. (#934)\r\n- Increased the max amount of VRAM PyTorch will use before tiling further in auto mode. Should improve performance a little bit more (#940)\r\n- PyTorch's _Convert To NCNN_ node now will not hide the outputs of the node when ONNX is not installed and instead will warn the user about it when attempting to run it. (#952)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix ONNX nodes reloading on every upscale. Now it loads once in _Load Model_ as it should. (#933)\r\n- Fixed the \"FATAL ERROR!\" message some users would get in their logs with NCNN during upscaling. (#947)\r\n- Potentially fixed other NCNN upscale issues, but need users to confirm for me.\r\n- Fixed NCNN GPU selector order problem (#948)\r\n- Improved modulo typing in _Math_ node (#938) (thanks @RunDevelopment)\r\n- Added pow typing in _Math_ node (#936) (thanks @RunDevelopment)\n# Alpha v0.12.4\nThis is another smaller update that adds a couple of new things and fixes a few bugs.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- GPU Selector for PyTorch & NCNN ([#919](https://github.com/joeyballentine/chaiNNer/pull/919))\r\n    - Long overdue, now you can select what GPU you want to use for PyTorch or NCNN. This is great for NCNN users as now you can have chaiNNer use your dedicated GPU instead of defaulting to your integrated GPU.\r\n    - This is in the \"Python\" tab in settings, in the PyTorch and NCNN sub-tabs\r\n    - If you have any issues that seem to stem from this change, please let me know. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed loading RealESRGAN model loading at scales other than 4x (tested with 8x and 2x) ([#921](https://github.com/joeyballentine/chaiNNer/pull/921))\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Resize to Side_ ([#910](https://github.com/joeyballentine/chaiNNer/pull/910)) (thanks @BigBoyBarney)\r\n    - Lets you resize conditionally based on the properties of the images\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Moved CPU & FP16 settings to the PyTorch sub-tab of the Python tab in settings\r\n- Added icons to settings tabs ([#922](https://github.com/joeyballentine/chaiNNer/pull/922))\r\n- Added modulo operator to _Math_ node ([#908](https://github.com/joeyballentine/chaiNNer/pull/908))\r\n\n# Alpha v0.12.3\nI accidentally broke PyTorch model loading in the last release, so this is merely a hotfix to fix that.\r\n\r\n##

MacOS clipboard improvements (#2031, thanks @stonerl)\r\n- Help menu improvements (#2041, thanks @stonerl)\r\n- Other MacOS improvements, such as a new icon (#2042, #2049, thanks @mafiosnik777)\r\n- Per-platform dependency description improvements (#2047, thanks @stonerl)\r\n- Add new option to enable hardware acceleration for the GUI rendering. We do not recommend enabling this unless you're using CPU upscaling as it will reduce GPU performance.
