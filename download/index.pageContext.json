If your drivers haven't been updated in over a year, PyTorch upscaling might start not working or being extremely slow.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Better node errors using error messages in output types by @RunDevelopment in #2445\r\n* Add a popup message on start for dependency updates by @joeyballentine in #2453, #2458\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed upscaling with transparency by @RunDevelopment in #2457\r\n\r\n## Other/Dev Changes\r\n* Replace global execution options with node context parameter by @RunDevelopment in #2444\r\n* Use screenToFlowPosition() instead of project() by @joeyballentine in #2459\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.21.0...v0.21.1\n# Alpha v0.21.0\nThis might be chaiNNer's biggest update ever! Sorry for how long it took, we spent a lot of time making sure this release had the polish we deemed necessary. There are a lot of big changes in this update, but here are some highlights: Better iterators, general optimizations, support for more PyTorch models, chain auto-organization, and much more. Here are the major changes in greater detail:\r\n\r\n### Better Iterators\r\nThis might not be the final step in our goal of getting iteration in chaiNNer to where we want to be, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. Iterators are no longer gigantic nodes with their own sub-flow editor in them. Now, they are single nodes that can be attached like normal, which makes working with iteration a whole lot easier. Not only that, but it also allows mixing and matching iterators and \"collectors\", so now you can do things like convert an image sequence to a video, or split a spritesheet to separate images.\r\n\r\nHowever, only one iterator is actually allowed to be part of the same chain \"lineage\", so you still are not able to do things like match multiple iterators together or combine an image iterator and a model iterator. That is a lot more complex and will hopefully come in the future. Oh yeah, and all the iterator nodes have new names as well, so instead of \"Image File Iterator\", look for \"Load Images\".\r\n\r\n### General Optimizations\r\nWe spent some time working on optimizing a few aspects of chaiNNer and generally improving speed. From making PyTorch upscales faster to optimizing things like resizing to making the frontend use less CPU, you should notice a general speedup all around.\r\n\r\n### Support for more PyTorch models\r\nPart of what made this release take a while was that we took a small break from working on chaiNNer to separate out our model support code into a new Python package called [Spandrel](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/spandrel). Doing so allowed us to more easily add support for a variety of new models (such as SPAN, Real-CUGAN, FBCNN, and more) and we even got some contributions from the community. Spandrel is now being used in AUTOMATIC1111's stable diffusion webui, and will most likely also be used in ComfyUI soon. If you want chaiNNer's automatic model support in your Python project, go check out Spandrel. To see a list of all the currently supported models, check [here](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/spandrel/tree/v0.1.7?tab=readme-ov-file#model-architecture-support).\r\n\r\n### Other notable changes\r\n- Chains can now be auto-formatted/organized using Edit > Format Chain (or using ctrl+shift+f).\r\n- Upscale tiling is now even more seamless, using a blending technique to avoid hard seams with certain models like SCUNet.\r\n- Some general UI improvements and quality-of-life additions.\r\n- Many new nodes.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the changelog:\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n\r\n###

https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.20.2...v0.21.0\r\n\n# Alpha v0.20.2\nHey everyone, sorry it took so long to get this out. This update contains a bunch of things that I thought we had already released -- a couple bug fixes and some cool new features. Some very big things are on the way though, so be on the lookout for the next update.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add Multi Gaussian filter to Normal Map Generator (#2255)\r\n- Add ability to limit the length of certain iterators (#2218)\r\n- Add support for sub-pixel distance transform (#2235) \r\n- (ncnn) Allow disabling Winograd/SGEMM (for cpu ncnn) (#2237 -- thanks @JeremyRand) \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed being able to close the dependency manager while installing deps (#2227)\r\n- Fixed RGBA preview image background (#2225) \r\n- Fixed pip using bad caches on dep installs (#2232)\r\n- Fixed dragging bug on image previews (#2236)\r\n- Fixed bug from read-only image in CAS (#2239)\r\n- Fixed CAS for grayscale images (#2241)\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to these maintainers: @joeyballentine and @RunDevelopment \n# Alpha v0.20.1\nThis is a hotfix to fix the Windows installer installing to the wrong place. If you installed v0.20.0 on Windows, I recommend checking if your system registers two separate chaiNNer installs, and uninstalling the extra one after applying this update. If your system is not registering a second chaiNNer instance, I recommend navigating to `C:\\Users\\[your user]\\AppData\\Local` and seeing if a directory called `app` exists, and if it contains `chaiNNer.exe`. If it does, I recommend just deleting that `app` directory entirely. The v0.20.1 installer ***will not*** automatically fix this for you. I am very sorry for this inconvenience. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix windows installer installing to the wrong place (#2219)\r\n- Fix PyTorch erroring when both CPU and FP16 modes were enabled (#2217)\n# Alpha v0.20.0\nHey everyone! This is a pretty major update with some pretty overdue changes. The main big change is that we've upgraded to Python 3.11 (for integrated Python) as well as PyTorch 2.0 (if you're using chaiNNer for its PyTorch capabilities). Between these two changes, you should hopefully see a bit of an overall speed boost when processing things. That isn't all that got changed though, so take a look at the rest of the changelog to see everything that's new.\r\n\r\nNOTE: After installing v0.20.0, integrated Python will be redownloaded, and you will need to re-install any dependencies you are using from the dependency manager (assuming you are not using system Python). Also, dependency-related settings have been reset in this build, so make sure to double-check that everything looks correct)\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Update Integrated Python to Python 3.11 (#2144, #2092)\r\n- _View Image_ nodes now have resizable image previews (#2167, #2174, #2205, #2214)\r\n- Improved _Video Frame Iterator_ codec and container selection (#2158 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n- Add ability to pass custom additional ffmpeg params to _Video Frame Iterator_ (#2158 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n- MacOS builds are now code-signed (#2136, #2180 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n- MacOS builds are now universal (x64 and arm64) (#2162, #2166 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- (PyTorch) DAT and SRFormer support (#2153, #2155, #2156)\r\n- (PyTorch) Support for reading .ckpt files (for certain models) (#2193)\r\n- (PyTorch) Support for DiffBR's SwinIR models (#2202)\r\n- (PyTorch) FP16 now gets enabled by default for compatible GPUs (#2203)\r\n- Linux build improvements (#2179 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n- Wayland Linux support (#2178 -- thanks @illode)\r\n- Added BC5_SNORM format and additional format information to DDS options in _Save Image_ (#2199)\r\n- Added support for uncompressed DDS (#2201, #2211)\r\n- Performance improvement for iterator progress updates that should use less CPU and lag the UI less (#2182)\r\n- Visually show feature-disabled nodes as disabled (#2194)\r\n- Added docs for Mip options in _Save Image_ (#2207)\r\n- Added anti-aliasing to Threshold node (#2209)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Text as Image_ (#2125, #2213 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n    -

It's been a while since the last update, and in my opinion, it's been worth the wait. We have a lot of interesting improvements and new features to share with all of you.\r\n\r\nFirst, we now have documentation for all available nodes. This can be accessed both by a button in the top right button bar, as well as by right-clicking on a node in the sidebar and clicking \"Open Documentation\". The documentation includes a lot of information about nodes and their inputs & outputs. Not to mention, the docs are also searchable. This will hopefully be a huge help to both new and existing users.\r\n\r\nSecond, the update screen has finally received a makeover. This has been a long-overdue change. Starting with 0.19.0, you will get a popup when there is a new update, which will have an option for ignoring the update or viewing the update's changelog. If you view the changelog, a modal will open that will show you a full changelog of the update -- or multiple updates if you happen to be a few versions behind. From there you can view the release on GitHub or open chaiNNer.app to download it. If you do choose to ignore the update, don't worry, because you will see a green download indicator next to chaiNNer's version number which you can click on to view the update again.\r\n\r\nThird, we've made some improvements to how the backend sets up chaiNNer. This is mostly to prep for future features, but it also conveniently makes it slightly easier to set up chaiNNer on a remote machine, as all the necessary dependencies will be installed via the backend, instead of the frontend. This shouldn't affect existing users much, except you may notice that on starting up chaiNNer this time you see a slightly different progress indication on the splash screen as it installs the few new necessary dependencies. We also now bundle a couple of small, cross-platform dependencies that should make first-time setup a bit faster. If anyone is having trouble with the new first-time setup process, definitely let us know ASAP.\r\n\r\nFourth, chaiNNer is now taking advantage of some first-party Rust code. This means we were able to speed up certain nodes by a significant amount. Expect future updates to improve the speed of other nodes as we move some intensive operations over to Rust.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the changelog:\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Node Documentation (#1880, #1900, #1902, #1923, #1925, #1928, #1926, #1932, #1929, #1930, #1937, #1946, #1950, #1952, #1956, #1961, #1962, #1963, #1993, #1992, #1995, #2004, #2009, #2017)\r\n- Update checking improvement (#1935)\r\n- Mandatory dependencies now get installed via the backend (#1834, #1856, #1862, #1863, #1866, #1869, #1881, #1882, #1878, #1885, #1960)\r\n- New design for sliders (#1966, #1971, #1976, #1975, #1977, #1986, #1987, #1988)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n- Added Contrast-Adaptive-Sharpening to _High Boost Filter_ (#1841)\r\n- Added weight loading for NCNN Scale op and fix InnerProduct bug (#1864)\r\n- Use `chainner_ext` (rust code) for _Fill Alpha_ (#1865)\r\n- Added nearest color mode for Fill Alpha (#1883)\r\n- Allow color inputs in merge transparency (#1888)\r\n- Improved type error messages for colors (#1889)\r\n- Add a wcmatch.glob field to image iterator (#1840, #1939, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n- Hide unimportant labels (#1919)\r\n- Add more algorithms to the _Color Transfer_ node (#1903, thanks @adegerard)\r\n- Update pytorch model file input label (#1927)\r\n- Add window size detection to OmniSR (#1933)\r\n- Splash screen is no longer always on top (#1938)\r\n- Better computed alpha for upscaling nodes (#1942)\r\n- Move system stats to backend (#1948)\r\n- Changed empty-string behavior of text inputs (#1954)\r\n- Shorter names for channel inputs/outputs in Split/Merge Transparency (#1967)\r\n- Stack many images on _Stack_ node (#1972)\r\n- Consistently use sliders for blur radius-like number inputs (#1973, #1978)\r\n- Optimized box blur implementation (#1974)\r\n- Optimized Gaussian blur (#1981)\r\n- Input number on enter (#1982)\r\n- Variable precision for log-scale sliders (#1984) \r\n- Added context menu entry to extract value into node (#1985)\r\n- Added linked inputs group (implemented for _Box Blur_) (#1983)\r\n- Use slider in Gamma node (#1989)\r\n- Renamed \"LUT\" to \"color palette\" (#1991)\r\n- Simplified printed structs by omitting default fields (#2003)\r\n- Use a later version of pytorch that supports MPS for Arm MacOS (#2012)\r\n- Update ONNX + ONNXRuntime & Improvements for ONNX on MacOS (#2010)\r\n- Some UI fine-tuning around GPU selection on Mac (#2020, thanks @stonerl)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Image Statistic_ (#1748) \r\n    - A node to get the min, max, mean, media, n-th percentile of an image.\r\n- _Get Bounding Box_ (#1884, #1901, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n    - Like _Crop Content_ except it returns a bounding box insted of cropping.\r\n- _Regex Replace_ (#1893)\r\n    - Like _Text Replace_, but uses a regex search.\r\n- _Fast NL means_ (#1890, thanks @adegerard)\r\n    - Uses Fast NL means to denoise an image.\r\n- _Pick Color_ (#1913)\r\n    - Grab the color of a pixel in an image.\r\n- _Directory_ (#1921)\r\n    - Pick a directory and reuse it throughout the chain, like you can with numbers and strings currently.\r\n- _Switch_ (#1945)\r\n    - Connect multiple inputs and select which one you want to output.\r\n- _Stretch Contrast_ (#1959)\r\n    - Auto-levels-like functionality.

I finally fixed the broken windows installer :)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed the windows installer not opening after install/update (#1830)\r\n- Fixed being unable to pass in electron-specific launch arguments to chaiNNer (#1830)\r\n- (unconfirmed) Fixed MacOS and Linux portable builds to be truly portable (#1829)\n# Alpha v0.18.8\nNote: this is another reminder that the windows installer doesn't open after installing. It's a known bug we haven't been able to fix \r\n\r\nAnother small update with some bug fixes and a couple of new features.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add FFv1 support to _Video Frame Iterator_ (#1779)\r\n- (onnx) Add FP16 option for tensorrt (#1795)\r\n- (pytorch) OmniSR Support (#1804, #1813, #1815)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Pixelate_ (#1777, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Pixelate an image, similar to Photoshop's \"Mosaic\" filter\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed bug with generating hashes after an upscale (#1797, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n- Fixed a bug that would show invalid nodes in the right-click node-selector context menu (#1821)\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks to the following maintainers: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment\n# Alpha v0.18.7\nThis is a small update with some new features and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Small performance optimizations (#1743)\r\n- Colors are now a data type and are selectable via color picker in many nodes (#1732)\r\n- Added missing previewing features on Text Areas (#1766)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Generate Hash_ (thanks @Zarxrax) (#1738)\r\n- _Z-Stack Images_ (thanks @JustNoon) (#1745)\r\n- (webui integration) _Image Upscale_ (thanks @mateusz) (#1692)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- (webui integration) fixed caching not respecting image changes (#1762)\r\n- Fixed _Fill Alpha_ causing errors in certain chains (#1768)\r\n- Fixed iterators not properly catching certain types of errors (#1771)\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to the maintainers who contributed to this release: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment\n# Alpha v0.18.6\nThis is a slightly bigger update that didn't quite qualify for a major version number.

We are still working on fixing that.\r\n\r\nThis is a small update which addresses some issues and adds a few features.\r\n- Don't forget to check out the previous changelog if you havent already updated to 0.18.0.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Better SD url detection (#1588, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Now compatible when the SD webui is running under `--nowebui` and TLS\r\n- (PyTorch) Add MAT support to inpainting (#1596, thanks @theflyingzamboni)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Create Noise_ (#1585, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Create images made up of Value/Simplex noise\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed iterator child nodes appearing underneath an iterator when the iterator was selected (#1593, thanks @joeyballentine)\r\n- Fixed SD not working on macos (#1588, thanks @adodge)\n# Alpha v0.18.0\nNOTE: The windows installer still doesn't open after it is done installing. It _does_ still install, so just manually open it after.\r\n\r\nA huge requested feature is finally here! (well, kinda). Stable Diffusion support was something I've wanted to add for a while. However, I never thought I'd be able to match the experience from the AUTOMATIC1111 webui. Luckily for us, @adodge thought of a brilliant workaround for that: Just use the webui. Specifically, the webui's API. This way, we wouldn't have to set up any new dependencies or worry about integrating the code incorrectly -- it would just work. The only problem with this approach is it does require you to run the webui in api mode (by running `./webui.(sh|bat) --api` _before_ chaiNNer starts up. This will make a new category with the SD nodes appear. At the moment adodge is looking into an internal implementation, but for now this works pretty well.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of other new features in this update as well, such as inpainting support (both via opencv and LaMa), rembg support, a bunch of new nodes, and more. See the full changelog below:\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Stable Diffusion support via the AUTOMATIC1111 webui API (#1500, #1540, #1553, #1559, #1562, #1557, #1575, #1586, #1583 thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Adds Stable Diffusion support to chaiNNer by running the webui in API mode\r\n    - Supports Text-To-Image, Image-To-Image, Outpaining, and clip interrogation\r\n- Node recatigorization (#1576, #1581)\r\n- LaMa inpainting support (#1569)\r\n- RemBG background removal support (#1533)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- The external Stable Diffusion nodes mentioned above.\r\n- _Color Levels_ (#1532, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Color levels adjustment similar to Gimp and Photoshop.\r\n- _Dither_ & _Dither (Palette) (#1502, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Dither an image, either by number of colors or with a specified palette.\r\n- _Palette From Image_  (#1502, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Generates a palette from an image, to be used with dithering.\r\n- _Convert Normal Maps_\r\n    - Allows conversion between DirectX and OpenGL normal maps, as well as to and from the octahedral normal map format used by RTX Remix\r\n- _Inpaint_ (#1546, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Uses a mask image to inpaint. This is _not_ an AI inpainting node, but something more similar to content aware fill.\r\n- _Create Gradient_ (#1544, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Generates a grayscale gradient with a variety of options, which can then be colorized using the LUT node.\r\n- _Signed Distance Field_ (#1552, thanks @adodge)\r\n    - Can be used to create low-resolution textures that can be scaled up rendered at a higher resolution with fewer artifacts.\r\n- _Dilate_ & _Erode_ (#1565, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - These two nodes work similarly to the dilate and erode features in Gimp and Blender.\r\n- (PyTorch) _Inpaint_ (#1569)\r\n    - Inpaint using the LaMa model, which performs significantly better than the opencv implementation used in the normal _Inpaint_ node.\r\n- (ONNX) _Remove Background_ (#1533)\r\n    - Remove the background of an image using .onnx RemBG models.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Added option to duplicate node with input connections (#1541)\r\n- Slightly improved type error messages (#1542, #1579)\r\n- Rearrange inputs on upscale nodes for consistency with other nodes (#1539, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n- Added \"export viewport to clipboard\" in the file menu (#1550)\r\n- Added more DDS output format options (#1555)\r\n- Added \"Copy Audio\" toggle for video iteration (#1563)\r\n- Added \"Use Pip Directly\" toggle in the dependency manager (#1560)\r\n- Changed the design of resize handles (#1584)\r\n- Create node on enter in search pane, when only one node is an option (#1578)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed the bug that would cause TextAreas (like what is used in the _Note_ node) to randomly get much larger (#1582)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, thanks to the maintainers: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni \n# Alpha v0.17.1\nNOTE: As a reminder, the windows installer still does not open after installing anymore. It still does install though, so just manually open it after installation. We are actively investigating why this happened.\r\n\r\nThis update includes some new nodes, a quality-of-life improvement related to stopping execution, even _more_ portability, and a bit more. See the full changelog below: \r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Long-running upscales can now be stopped, without chaiNNer seeming to hang (#1521)\r\n- Added DDS option for separating alpha (#1510)\r\n- Slight styling changes for slider input numbers (#1504)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Random Number_ (#1499, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n    - Allows using a randomly generated number for number inputs\r\n- NCNN Model File Iterator\r\n    - Similar to the PyTorch model file iterator, these allow you to iterate over folders of NCNN models.\r\n- ONNX Model File Iterator\r\n    - Ditto above, but for ONNX\r\n- _Lens Blur_ (#1516, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Applies lens blur to an image\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed RGBA DDS loading (#1514)\r\n- Fixed chaiNNer closing when visiting the update link, or dismissing the box (#1518)\r\n- Fixed some missing portability when using a portable zip (#1523, #1530)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, thanks @joeyballentine and @RunDevelopment \n# Alpha v0.17.0\nNOTE: with this release it seems chaiNNer no long automatically opens after installing an update -- don't worry though, the installer still works.\r\n\r\nThis update adds a few somewhat important dependency updates for system compatibility reasons, as well as a few major new features, and lots of minor ones. \r\n\r\nI'll keep this brief this time, and just have you read the changelog below:\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n- ONNX -> 1.13\r\n    - With this update, ARM (M1/M2) MacOS users can now use ONNX, since this update provides an arm64 MacOS version. This means you can properly convert to NCNN through ONNX.\r\n- OpenCV -> 4.7 (automatic)\r\n    - Usually I don't mention dependencies that update automatically, but I wanted to mention this one specifically -- because now we should theoretically support MacOS versions under 10.15, specifically to 10.13 now. This has not been officially tested by us, but it _should_ work. We probably scared away all the < 10.15 people by now, but if any of you see this, please give it a try now.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- CLI Mode (#1469, #1470, #1468, #1489, #1492, #1494)\r\n    - This was our first-ever commissioned feature, so thanks to Flaviu Radulescu for funding this feature.\r\n    - This feature now allows you to execute chains from the command-line, without needing the GUI to run. This includes being able to override inputs for easier chain reuse.\r\n    - Documentation can be found by running `chainner run --help` in the command line.\r\n- True portability for zip builds (#1484, #1487, #1489)\r\n    - ZIP builds were never truly portable as integrated python, settings, and a few other things were saved to appdata. Now, these will download & save to the root directory of the exe.\r\n    - If you don't want this functionality, simply delete the `portable` file that is now present in the zip builds.\r\n- Improved startup speed (#1468)\r\n    - chaiNNer now starts up significantly faster than it used to (assuming it has already gone through first-time setup and updates)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Image Convolve_ (#1442, thanks @JumpyJacko)\r\n    - Runs arbitrary convolution with a user-defined kernel\r\n- _Metal to Specular_ & _Specular to Metal_ (#1457)\r\n    - Converts metal/specular maps to specular/metal maps\r\n- _Number_ & _Text_\r\n    - These nodes allow easy re-use of numbers or text between nodes\r\n- _Apply LUT_\r\n    - You can now apply a Look-Up Table (LUT) to images\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Support for mode DDS formats (#1471)\r\n    - This is specifically DXT1, DXT3, and DXT5. This is still a Windows-only feature.\r\n- Improved JPEG saving options (#1480, #1483)\r\n    - This includes adding a chroma subsampling dropdown as well as a \"progressive\" option\r\n- Allow dragging videos into chaiNNer for loading like images/models (#1488)\r\n- Enhanced type tag size (#1404, #1478)\r\n- Added output alpha option to _Change Colorspace_ (#1405)\r\n- Made directory and file name output types immediately computed (#1408)\r\n- Added angle addition method for normal maps (#1409)\r\n- Better error message when loading a PyTorch model fails (#1433)\r\n- Add seed input to _Add Noise_ node (#1444)\r\n- Made the output type for _Math_ node a bit better (#1452)\r\n- Improved some type error messages (#1493)\r\n- Improved logging (#1495)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed a small issue with number input width (#1443)\r\n- Fixed potential errors caused by manually clearing PyTorch memory during out-of-vram events (#1456)\r\n\r\nAnd as always thanks to the maintainers: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni\n# Alpha v0.16.1\nThis is just a minor update which includes a couple of fixes and QOL improvements. Make sure to check last version's changelog if you haven't grabbed that version yet.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- Better execution time formatting (#1392, #1394)\r\n- Increase default codeformer weight to 0.7 (#1381)\r\n- Replaced some true/false dropdown inputs with checkboxes (#1377)\r\n- Changed max of _Add Normals_ amount to 200% (#1398)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Made text of dropdown options larger (#1375)\r\n- Fixed DDS rename not working across drives (#1376)\r\n- Removed broken window menu from menu bar (#1386)\r\n- Fixed some errors not showing in the UI (#1407)\r\n\r\nAs always thanks to @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment and @theflyingzamboni for contributing to this release.\n# Alpha v0.16.0\nThis is a pretty big update with some noticeable changes and improvements, including a design overhaul and many quality-of-life features.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n\r\n- Major UI improvements (#1305, #1326, #1302, #1313, #1314, #1330, #1340)\r\n\r\n    - The first thing you might notice in this version is a bit of a redesign. Nodes have been majorly overhauled to be much more compact. While it might be a bit of a shock how different it looks at first, I guarantee you'll quickly get used to it and prefer this new look. The compactness of the nodes gives you much more space to fill out your chains with, and there is just a lot less wasted space overall. Check out [this comparison of the space used by the old vs the new nodes](https://imgsli.com/MTM4NDgy)  \r\n    - With this compactness change also came a change to sliders. In my opinion, they are now a lot easier to see and interact with, and are closer to something like you'd see in blender.  \r\n    - There have also been changes to pop-up boxes. Settings had a bit of an overhaul to fix some scrolling issues, and all pop-ups now have a darker color. Alerts also got icons representing the type of alert.  \r\n\r\n- Node-on-Connection insertion (#1231, #1341)\r\n\r\n    - Something we all have always wanted in chaiNNer was the ability to insert a compatible node in-between two connected nodes, without having to delete the connection and make two new ones. Well, now this is a reality. All you have to do is hold `alt` while dragging a node in the editor, and both the node and the connection line will visually show you that the node is able to be connected this way. It's really convenient to be able to insert nodes into existing chains this way, and can save a lot of time.\r\n\r\n- Informing you about invalid connections (#1299, #1306, #1308)\r\n\r\n    - The UI now will inform you when a connection you are trying to make is invalid. Before, we would tell you why a node was invalid _after_ it was already connected and then made invalid. However, we had never explained why some connections were not possible to begin with. This had confused many users as they would try to do things like connect a GFPGAN model to _Upscale Image_ and think there was something wrong rather than it being something intentional. While the UI would not let these users make that connection, it would not tell them _why_. This update adds an explanation tooltip that explains why a connection can't be made as you attempt to drop the connection on a handle. This should hopefully improve the user experience and lead to less confusion when this happens.\r\n\r\n- Increased _View Image_ preview resolution (#1290, #1342, #1351)\r\n\r\n    - _View Image_ just became a lot more useful. Now, instead of seeing only a 512x512 preview of your image, you will see a maximum of 2K resolution when zoomed in to the max. This still isn't ideal for extremely large images (larger than 2k) where you need to zoom in even more than chaiNNer allows, but a feature for that will be coming in the future. For now, this is a huge improvement and makes in-line previewing much much better. We also improved the performance of the node, so you may notice previews loading a bit faster than they used to.\r\n\r\n- Better DDS Support (Reading & writing, Windows only) (#1266, #1356)\r\n\r\n    - With this update, previously unsupported DDS textures files can now be read and written on Windows. We make use of Texconv, which is a small texture utility that we now bundle with chaiNNer. Unfortunately, Textconv is Windows-only, meaning Linux & MacOS users will not be able to take advantage of this. But we figured it was still better to have it than not.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n- CodeFormer support (#1327)\r\n  - This Face Upscaling architecture was highly requested to be added, and now you can use it in chaiNNer with the Face Upscale node.\r\n- NCNN Optimizer (#1259)\r\n  - NCNN models now get optimized on load as well as on convert, which can save help them save a little bit of time when upscaling. For most models, this will only be minute optimizations, but for batch upscaling it can save quite a lot of time overall.\r\n- Show current overall execution progress on taskbar (#1343, #1365)\r\n- Made amount input a slider in _High Boost Filter_ (#1288)\r\n- Added amount and threshold inputs for _Unsharp Mask_ (#1293, #1294)\r\n- Added the ability to cache ONNX TensorRT conversions (#1287)\r\n- Added a context menu for multi-node selections (#1289)\r\n- Added Ko-fi donation button to header (#1300)\r\n- Improved _Convert Colorspace_ node to be more generalized for alpha modes (#1322)\r\n- Add .avs support to the video selection menu (#1345)\r\n- Allow users to select alert text (#1349)\r\n- Support node-search context menu in iterators (#1369)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n\r\n- _Create Color_ (#1285)\r\n  - Three new nodes that allow you to create single-color images in RGB, RGBA, or Grayscale.\r\n- _Surface Blur_ (#1292)\r\n  - This node blurs an image using a bilateral blur filter, also known as \"surface blur.\"\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed picking a custom python path (#1283, #1284, #1315)\r\n- Fixed FaceSR (GFPGAN, RestoreFormer) and Transformer-model (SwinIR, HAT, Swin2SR) interpolation (#1281)\r\n- Fixed the file select window prompting you to create files when opening directories that do not exist (#1282)\r\n- Fixed the integrated FFMPEG download error to just be a warning (#1279)\r\n- Fixed blurry checkers in image preview (#1320)\r\n- Fixed being able to select text in file and directory inputs (#1331)\r\n- Fixed opening a file with chaiNNer while an existing chaiNNer instance is already open (#1344)\r\n- Fixed exact-size ONNX models not being properly run (#1336)\r\n- Disallow negative crop values (#1350)\r\n\r\n## Experimental Features\r\n\r\n- While not enabled/disable behind the experimental features setting, both Apple MPS (via pytorch-nightly) and Microsoft DML (via pytorch-directml) support should _theoretically_ work with a proper environment set up through your system python. People who have tried to set this up have had issues though, and ultimately I need more people to test this before I can officially say we support these things. However, if you want to test it yourself and know how to set these things up, feel free to give it a go and report back to us.
