This release brings the features from the nightly version to stable (with many of the reported bugs from the nightly version fixed).\r\n\r\nThe main new feature is support for using multiple iterators of equal length together.

Well, mostly. These nodes allow you to switch between inputs based on a condition created by comparing two values in various ways. This means users can finally set up chains that do one thing under a certain condition and another thing under a different one (e.g. if an image is over a certain size vs under a certain size). The thing to keep in mind is how you have to set this up might be opposite of what's intuitive. Since you're switching between values, it's what comes _before_ the condition that is decided between, not what comes after.\r\n\r\nThe disable toggle has also been replaced with a button that allows you to swap between three states: \"enabled\", \"disabled\", and \"skipped\". In skipped mode, the node will not be run, but it also will not disable downstream nodes like disabling it would. This is another heavily-requested feature that we are happy is finally in chaiNNer.\r\n\r\nNew themes can be selected in settings. This is semi-experimental as we plan on adding support for fully custom themes in the future, as well as improving the existing default selection. The current selection is mainly just a proof of concept to show that we _can_ support themes of some kind, and also to give users some options for customization. We'd love to hear feedback on the current selection and if you have any suggestions on themes to add.\r\n\r\nPyTorch upscaling has been heavily optimized. I was able to using a visual profiling tool (called VizTracer, which I highly recommend for anyone wanting to optimize a python project) to see what was slowing down upscaling. Upscaling has been optimized to a point where it's roughly 1.25x faster than it was before (though YMMV depending on what model you use, as well as other factors). While not perfect, it's still a large improvement and should help your PyTorch upscaling chains run faster.\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n* Support passthrough/skipping nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2805, #2864, #2887\r\n* Add new themes by @joeyballentine in #2833, #2847, #2874, #2921\r\n* Various optimizations to PyTorch upscaling by @joeyballentine in #2853, #2852, #2861, #2859, #2858, #2860, #2862, #2869, #2884, #2886\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n* Add avif support by @the-database in #2820\r\n* Add convolve usage example by @BigBoyBarney in #2827\r\n* (PyTorch) Add custom tiling option by @the-database in #2828, #2870, #2880\r\n* (PyTorch) Update spandrel (adds support for PLKSR, RealPLKSR, IPT, SAFMN_BCIE, DRCT) by @RunDevelopment in #2837, #2846\r\n* Default chain file saving to documents folder by @joeyballentine in #2836\r\n* Rename parameters of numeric inputs and clean up parameters by @RunDevelopment in #2863\r\n* Increase font size for type tags by @RunDevelopment in #2865\r\n* Make all Switch inputs optional by @RunDevelopment in #2867\r\n* Slightly redesign the Math node by @RunDevelopment, @joeyballentine in #2868, #2873\r\n* Better type errors for text nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2871\r\n* Add \"order\" dropdown for both spritesheet nodes by @joeyballentine in #2878\r\n* Improve style of multiline text area by @RunDevelopment in #2885\r\n* Add a \"simple\" mode for saving video by @joeyballentine in #2879\r\n* Slightly more space for text in dropdowns by @RunDevelopment in #2892\r\n* Slightly more compact Save Video node by @RunDevelopment in #2893\r\n* Optimize away Passthrough nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2896\r\n* Add type color for Booleans by @joeyballentine in #2891\r\n* Add type color for Colors by @joeyballentine in #2898, #2904\r\n* Stricter condition for type assignability by @RunDevelopment in #2902\r\n* Select best-matching node based on search query by @RunDevelopment in #2903\r\n* Support connected handles with multiple colors by @RunDevelopment in #2906\r\n* Better type error message for division by zero by @RunDevelopment in #2907\r\n* Fix assignability for outputs with errors by @RunDevelopment in #2909\r\n* Add special suggestion for Math and Compare nodes in node selector by @RunDevelopment in #2908\r\n* Mention node names in error messages by @RunDevelopment in #2920\r\n* Add similarity check to ONNX model conversions by @RunDevelopment in #2915\r\n* Add support for ONNX type and tag broadcasting by @RunDevelopment in #2919\r\n* Improve types for model conversion nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2925\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n* Add \"Compare\" & \"Conditional\" nodes by @RunDevelopment in #2866, #2895\r\n* Add \"Image Align with Rife\" and \"Wavelet Color Fix\" Nodes by @pifroggi, @RunDevelopment in #2714, #2888, #2889\r\n* Add \"Regex Find\" node by @RunDevelopment in #2855\r\n* Add \"Separate Color\" node by @joeyballentine, @RunDevelopmentg in #2897, #2910\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed input gathering for collectors by @RunDevelopment in #2818\r\n* Use `atexit` to always kill worker by @RunDevelopment in #2822\r\n* Rework GPU API to fix issues with older GPUs by @RunDevelopment in #2821\r\n* Avoid RGB contamination by transparent pixels in \"Color Transfer\" node by @Splendide-Imaginarius in #2389\r\n* Prevent chain files from being saved in install directory by @joeyballentine in #2835\r\n* Fix that empty string was not allowed as the default value by @RunDevelopment in #2856\r\n* Fix converting indexed PIL images to NumPy by @RunDevelopment in #2881\r\n* Fix node documentation modal opening on reload by @joeyballentine in #2883\r\n* Fix timing issue for lazy inputs by @RunDevelopment in #2890\r\n* Prevent log spam by not logging useless stack traces by @RunDevelopment in #2900\\\r\n* Fix image pairs length validation when using limit by @joeyballentine in #2917\r\n* (ONNX) Fix size requirement padding by @RunDevelopment in #2918\r\n* Add status API to get executor status to prevent stale/stuck status by @RunDevelopment in #2928\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @the-database made their first contribution in #2820\r\n* @pifroggi made their first contribution in #2714\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.23.2...v0.24.0\n# Alpha v0.23.3\nThis is a hotfix release to fix a regression introduced in the v0.23.2 which caused iterators to error when running.

If your drivers haven't been updated in over a year, PyTorch upscaling might start not working or being extremely slow.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Better node errors using error messages in output types by @RunDevelopment in #2445\r\n* Add a popup message on start for dependency updates by @joeyballentine in #2453, #2458\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fixed upscaling with transparency by @RunDevelopment in #2457\r\n\r\n## Other/Dev Changes\r\n* Replace global execution options with node context parameter by @RunDevelopment in #2444\r\n* Use screenToFlowPosition() instead of project() by @joeyballentine in #2459\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.21.0...v0.21.1\n# Alpha v0.21.0\nThis might be chaiNNer's biggest update ever! Sorry for how long it took, we spent a lot of time making sure this release had the polish we deemed necessary. There are a lot of big changes in this update, but here are some highlights: Better iterators, general optimizations, support for more PyTorch models, chain auto-organization, and much more. Here are the major changes in greater detail:\r\n\r\n### Better Iterators\r\nThis might not be the final step in our goal of getting iteration in chaiNNer to where we want to be, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. Iterators are no longer gigantic nodes with their own sub-flow editor in them. Now, they are single nodes that can be attached like normal, which makes working with iteration a whole lot easier. Not only that, but it also allows mixing and matching iterators and \"collectors\", so now you can do things like convert an image sequence to a video, or split a spritesheet to separate images.\r\n\r\nHowever, only one iterator is actually allowed to be part of the same chain \"lineage\", so you still are not able to do things like match multiple iterators together or combine an image iterator and a model iterator. That is a lot more complex and will hopefully come in the future. Oh yeah, and all the iterator nodes have new names as well, so instead of \"Image File Iterator\", look for \"Load Images\".\r\n\r\n### General Optimizations\r\nWe spent some time working on optimizing a few aspects of chaiNNer and generally improving speed. From making PyTorch upscales faster to optimizing things like resizing to making the frontend use less CPU, you should notice a general speedup all around.\r\n\r\n### Support for more PyTorch models\r\nPart of what made this release take a while was that we took a small break from working on chaiNNer to separate out our model support code into a new Python package called [Spandrel](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/spandrel). Doing so allowed us to more easily add support for a variety of new models (such as SPAN, Real-CUGAN, FBCNN, and more) and we even got some contributions from the community. Spandrel is now being used in AUTOMATIC1111's stable diffusion webui, and will most likely also be used in ComfyUI soon. If you want chaiNNer's automatic model support in your Python project, go check out Spandrel. To see a list of all the currently supported models, check [here](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/spandrel/tree/v0.1.7?tab=readme-ov-file#model-architecture-support).\r\n\r\n### Other notable changes\r\n- Chains can now be auto-formatted/organized using Edit > Format Chain (or using ctrl+shift+f).\r\n- Upscale tiling is now even more seamless, using a blending technique to avoid hard seams with certain models like SCUNet.\r\n- Some general UI improvements and quality-of-life additions.\r\n- Many new nodes.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the changelog:\r\n\r\n## Dependency Updates\r\n\r\n###

https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer/compare/v0.20.2...v0.21.0\r\n\n# Alpha v0.20.2\nHey everyone, sorry it took so long to get this out. This update contains a bunch of things that I thought we had already released -- a couple bug fixes and some cool new features. Some very big things are on the way though, so be on the lookout for the next update.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add Multi Gaussian filter to Normal Map Generator (#2255)\r\n- Add ability to limit the length of certain iterators (#2218)\r\n- Add support for sub-pixel distance transform (#2235) \r\n- (ncnn) Allow disabling Winograd/SGEMM (for cpu ncnn) (#2237 -- thanks @JeremyRand) \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed being able to close the dependency manager while installing deps (#2227)\r\n- Fixed RGBA preview image background (#2225) \r\n- Fixed pip using bad caches on dep installs (#2232)\r\n- Fixed dragging bug on image previews (#2236)\r\n- Fixed bug from read-only image in CAS (#2239)\r\n- Fixed CAS for grayscale images (#2241)\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to these maintainers: @joeyballentine and @RunDevelopment \n# Alpha v0.20.1\nThis is a hotfix to fix the Windows installer installing to the wrong place. If you installed v0.20.0 on Windows, I recommend checking if your system registers two separate chaiNNer installs, and uninstalling the extra one after applying this update. If your system is not registering a second chaiNNer instance, I recommend navigating to `C:\\Users\\[your user]\\AppData\\Local` and seeing if a directory called `app` exists, and if it contains `chaiNNer.exe`. If it does, I recommend just deleting that `app` directory entirely. The v0.20.1 installer ***will not*** automatically fix this for you. I am very sorry for this inconvenience. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix windows installer installing to the wrong place (#2219)\r\n- Fix PyTorch erroring when both CPU and FP16 modes were enabled (#2217)\n# Alpha v0.20.0\nHey everyone! This is a pretty major update with some pretty overdue changes. The main big change is that we've upgraded to Python 3.11 (for integrated Python) as well as PyTorch 2.0 (if you're using chaiNNer for its PyTorch capabilities). Between these two changes, you should hopefully see a bit of an overall speed boost when processing things. That isn't all that got changed though, so take a look at the rest of the changelog to see everything that's new.\r\n\r\nNOTE: After installing v0.20.0, integrated Python will be redownloaded, and you will need to re-install any dependencies you are using from the dependency manager (assuming you are not using system Python). Also, dependency-related settings have been reset in this build, so make sure to double-check that everything looks correct)\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Update Integrated Python to Python 3.11 (#2144, #2092)\r\n- _View Image_ nodes now have resizable image previews (#2167, #2174, #2205, #2214)\r\n- Improved _Video Frame Iterator_ codec and container selection (#2158 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n- Add ability to pass custom additional ffmpeg params to _Video Frame Iterator_ (#2158 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n- MacOS builds are now code-signed (#2136, #2180 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n- MacOS builds are now universal (x64 and arm64) (#2162, #2166 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- (PyTorch) DAT and SRFormer support (#2153, #2155, #2156)\r\n- (PyTorch) Support for reading .ckpt files (for certain models) (#2193)\r\n- (PyTorch) Support for DiffBR's SwinIR models (#2202)\r\n- (PyTorch) FP16 now gets enabled by default for compatible GPUs (#2203)\r\n- Linux build improvements (#2179 -- thanks @stonerl)\r\n- Wayland Linux support (#2178 -- thanks @illode)\r\n- Added BC5_SNORM format and additional format information to DDS options in _Save Image_ (#2199)\r\n- Added support for uncompressed DDS (#2201, #2211)\r\n- Performance improvement for iterator progress updates that should use less CPU and lag the UI less (#2182)\r\n- Visually show feature-disabled nodes as disabled (#2194)\r\n- Added docs for Mip options in _Save Image_ (#2207)\r\n- Added anti-aliasing to Threshold node (#2209)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Text as Image_ (#2125, #2213 -- thanks @adegerard)\r\n    -

It's been a while since the last update, and in my opinion, it's been worth the wait. We have a lot of interesting improvements and new features to share with all of you.\r\n\r\nFirst, we now have documentation for all available nodes. This can be accessed both by a button in the top right button bar, as well as by right-clicking on a node in the sidebar and clicking \"Open Documentation\". The documentation includes a lot of information about nodes and their inputs & outputs. Not to mention, the docs are also searchable. This will hopefully be a huge help to both new and existing users.\r\n\r\nSecond, the update screen has finally received a makeover. This has been a long-overdue change. Starting with 0.19.0, you will get a popup when there is a new update, which will have an option for ignoring the update or viewing the update's changelog. If you view the changelog, a modal will open that will show you a full changelog of the update -- or multiple updates if you happen to be a few versions behind. From there you can view the release on GitHub or open chaiNNer.app to download it. If you do choose to ignore the update, don't worry, because you will see a green download indicator next to chaiNNer's version number which you can click on to view the update again.\r\n\r\nThird, we've made some improvements to how the backend sets up chaiNNer. This is mostly to prep for future features, but it also conveniently makes it slightly easier to set up chaiNNer on a remote machine, as all the necessary dependencies will be installed via the backend, instead of the frontend. This shouldn't affect existing users much, except you may notice that on starting up chaiNNer this time you see a slightly different progress indication on the splash screen as it installs the few new necessary dependencies. We also now bundle a couple of small, cross-platform dependencies that should make first-time setup a bit faster. If anyone is having trouble with the new first-time setup process, definitely let us know ASAP.\r\n\r\nFourth, chaiNNer is now taking advantage of some first-party Rust code. This means we were able to speed up certain nodes by a significant amount. Expect future updates to improve the speed of other nodes as we move some intensive operations over to Rust.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the changelog:\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n- Node Documentation (#1880, #1900, #1902, #1923, #1925, #1928, #1926, #1932, #1929, #1930, #1937, #1946, #1950, #1952, #1956, #1961, #1962, #1963, #1993, #1992, #1995, #2004, #2009, #2017)\r\n- Update checking improvement (#1935)\r\n- Mandatory dependencies now get installed via the backend (#1834, #1856, #1862, #1863, #1866, #1869, #1881, #1882, #1878, #1885, #1960)\r\n- New design for sliders (#1966, #1971, #1976, #1975, #1977, #1986, #1987, #1988)\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n- Added Contrast-Adaptive-Sharpening to _High Boost Filter_ (#1841)\r\n- Added weight loading for NCNN Scale op and fix InnerProduct bug (#1864)\r\n- Use `chainner_ext` (rust code) for _Fill Alpha_ (#1865)\r\n- Added nearest color mode for Fill Alpha (#1883)\r\n- Allow color inputs in merge transparency (#1888)\r\n- Improved type error messages for colors (#1889)\r\n- Add a wcmatch.glob field to image iterator (#1840, #1939, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n- Hide unimportant labels (#1919)\r\n- Add more algorithms to the _Color Transfer_ node (#1903, thanks @adegerard)\r\n- Update pytorch model file input label (#1927)\r\n- Add window size detection to OmniSR (#1933)\r\n- Splash screen is no longer always on top (#1938)\r\n- Better computed alpha for upscaling nodes (#1942)\r\n- Move system stats to backend (#1948)\r\n- Changed empty-string behavior of text inputs (#1954)\r\n- Shorter names for channel inputs/outputs in Split/Merge Transparency (#1967)\r\n- Stack many images on _Stack_ node (#1972)\r\n- Consistently use sliders for blur radius-like number inputs (#1973, #1978)\r\n- Optimized box blur implementation (#1974)\r\n- Optimized Gaussian blur (#1981)\r\n- Input number on enter (#1982)\r\n- Variable precision for log-scale sliders (#1984) \r\n- Added context menu entry to extract value into node (#1985)\r\n- Added linked inputs group (implemented for _Box Blur_) (#1983)\r\n- Use slider in Gamma node (#1989)\r\n- Renamed \"LUT\" to \"color palette\" (#1991)\r\n- Simplified printed structs by omitting default fields (#2003)\r\n- Use a later version of pytorch that supports MPS for Arm MacOS (#2012)\r\n- Update ONNX + ONNXRuntime & Improvements for ONNX on MacOS (#2010)\r\n- Some UI fine-tuning around GPU selection on Mac (#2020, thanks @stonerl)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Image Statistic_ (#1748) \r\n    - A node to get the min, max, mean, media, n-th percentile of an image.\r\n- _Get Bounding Box_ (#1884, #1901, thanks @zeptofine)\r\n    - Like _Crop Content_ except it returns a bounding box insted of cropping.\r\n- _Regex Replace_ (#1893)\r\n    - Like _Text Replace_, but uses a regex search.\r\n- _Fast NL means_ (#1890, thanks @adegerard)\r\n    - Uses Fast NL means to denoise an image.\r\n- _Pick Color_ (#1913)\r\n    - Grab the color of a pixel in an image.\r\n- _Directory_ (#1921)\r\n    - Pick a directory and reuse it throughout the chain, like you can with numbers and strings currently.\r\n- _Switch_ (#1945)\r\n    - Connect multiple inputs and select which one you want to output.\r\n- _Stretch Contrast_ (#1959)\r\n    - Auto-levels-like functionality.

I finally fixed the broken windows installer :)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed the windows installer not opening after install/update (#1830)\r\n- Fixed being unable to pass in electron-specific launch arguments to chaiNNer (#1830)\r\n- (unconfirmed) Fixed MacOS and Linux portable builds to be truly portable (#1829)\n# Alpha v0.18.8\nNote: this is another reminder that the windows installer doesn't open after installing. It's a known bug we haven't been able to fix \r\n\r\nAnother small update with some bug fixes and a couple of new features.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add FFv1 support to _Video Frame Iterator_ (#1779)\r\n- (onnx) Add FP16 option for tensorrt (#1795)\r\n- (pytorch) OmniSR Support (#1804, #1813, #1815)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Pixelate_ (#1777, thanks @harisreedhar)\r\n    - Pixelate an image, similar to Photoshop's \"Mosaic\" filter\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed bug with generating hashes after an upscale (#1797, thanks @Zarxrax)\r\n- Fixed a bug that would show invalid nodes in the right-click node-selector context menu (#1821)\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks to the following maintainers: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment\n# Alpha v0.18.7\nThis is a small update with some new features and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Small performance optimizations (#1743)\r\n- Colors are now a data type and are selectable via color picker in many nodes (#1732)\r\n- Added missing previewing features on Text Areas (#1766)\r\n\r\n## New Nodes\r\n- _Generate Hash_ (thanks @Zarxrax) (#1738)\r\n- _Z-Stack Images_ (thanks @JustNoon) (#1745)\r\n- (webui integration) _Image Upscale_ (thanks @mateusz) (#1692)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- (webui integration) fixed caching not respecting image changes (#1762)\r\n- Fixed _Fill Alpha_ causing errors in certain chains (#1768)\r\n- Fixed iterators not properly catching certain types of errors (#1771)\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to the maintainers who contributed to this release: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment\n# Alpha v0.18.6\nThis is a slightly bigger update that didn't quite qualify for a major version number. It includes lots of bug fixes and a few new highly-requested features.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Changed some node ordering and group names (#1679)\r\n- Add weight support to CodeFormer when using _Face Upscale_ (#1714)\r\n- Add ETA to iterators (#1730)\r\n- Optimizations (#1710, #1717)\r\n- Rename _Spritesheet Iterator_'s dimension inputs (#1716)\r\n- Only show the \"Separate Alpha\" option for RGBA images (#1721)\r\n- Better generated error reports (#1724)\r\n- Removed the \"disable hardware acceleration\" option, and always disable hardware acceleration (#1722). A user noticed that having it off _significantly_ improved upscaling times, so we figure there is no reason to use it (all of us devs have had it off). If you need an override because disabled hw acceleration is causing issues, please let us know.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed a bug with Combine RGB if no alpha channel was given (#1715)\r\n- Fixed some bugs with output normalization (#1717)\r\n- Fix ESRGAN-2c2 scale detection for lower scales (#1712, #1729)\r\n- Fix \"isDestroyed\" startup errors (#1724)\r\n- Fixed SD nodes not having text input handles (#1728)\r\n- Fixed \"Copy audio\" when input video does not have an audio stream (#1733)\r\n- Added support for using a later version of PyTorch when using system Python with 3.10, as previously it would just fail (#1672)\r\n\r\nThanks to the maintainers that contributed to this release: @joeyballentine @RunDevelopment @theflyingzamboni \n# Alpha v0.18.5\nThis is a small bugfix release that addresses a few issues some users noticed since the last release.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add ISNet support to ONNX background removal (#1706)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix ONNX RemBG node error (#1706)\r\n- Fixed iterators constantly reloading starting nodes (#1702)\r\n- Fix \"dynamic scale\" (they aren't really dynamic scale, but they act like it) realesrgan NCNN models (#1698)\r\n- Fixed image dimensions in error messages (#1701)\r\n\r\nThanks to the contributing maintainers: @RunDevelopment and @theflyingzamboni \n# Alpha v0.18.4\nThis version fixes a critical error that many people have experienced trying to install chaiNNer today, as well as adds a bunch of small new things and fixes some other bugs.
